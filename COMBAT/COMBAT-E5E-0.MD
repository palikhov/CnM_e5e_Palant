### Energy Drain

Energy Drain (Constitution)

An Energy Drain attack takes away levels from the victim unless a successful Saving Throw is made.

Most Energy Drain attacks require a successful melee attack. Mere physical contact is not enough. The full effect of an Energy Drain, such as the number of levels taken away, is specified in the monster, magic item, or spell description causing the drain. If it is not specified, 1 level is removed.

A character who loses a level this way suffers the effects of the drain immediately. The character loses one Hit Die of Hit Points (average HPs) of the appropriate class, and all other class features are reduced to the new level. The victims experience point total is immediately set to the midpoint point of the previous level.

A character drained below 1st level is instantly slain. Depending on the creature that killed the character, the character may rise the next night as a monster of that kind. If not, the character rises as a wight.

Lost levels remain until removed by spells, such as Greater Restoration, or other means. Sometimes level loss is temporary and will return to normal in a day's time. A creature gains temporary Hit Points each time it successfully uses its innate Energy Drain ability. Unless specified otherwise, the creature gains the amount of Hit Points that the victim loses. Energy Drain through spell or magic item does not grant temporary Hit Points unless their description indicates otherwise


### Ability damage and drain

Ability Damage or Drain (Constitution Saving Throws negates)

Ability damage typically results from the ravages of disease, the ill-effects of poison, or through the baleful powers of monstrous creatures and spellcasters. Creatures with that deal ability damage or ability drain inflict such damage in addition to the normal, Hit Point, damage of their natural attack.
Ability damage is temporary, healing at the rate of 1 point per day of rest. Ability drain, on the other hand, permanently lowers one or more of the target’s ability scores. Nothing short of a Restoration spell reverses such ability loss. Permanent ability drain results from the attacks of undead creatures, such as vampires and wraiths, and other dreadful creatures, such as lamias.
No ability scores can be damaged or drained to a value below 0. If a character’s Constitution is reduced to a score of zero, that character is slain. If any other ability score is reduced to a score of zero, the character is rendered immobile (in the case of Strength or Dexterity) or comatose (in the case of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).
