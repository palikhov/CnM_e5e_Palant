## Archdruid of the Moon

For a more interesting battle with an archdruid, you can change the rules of its Change Shape ability to more accurately reflect the class feature: instead of the archdruid sharing its pool of hit points with its animal shapes, each animal shape has its original hit points which are independent of the archdruid's. The party must defeat each animal shape individually before ultimately defeating the archdruid in its true form.

This works best if you choose two different animals.

Additionally, you can remove the CR limitation on the archdruid's animal shapes, allowing it to transform into any beast that exists in its world.

If you make these changes, the CR of the archdruid isn't changed. Instead, you add the appropriate XP of each animal shape to the amount of XP your party gains upon defeating the archdruid.

## Beastmaster

The beastmaster's challenge rating doesn't include its animal companion. Since we're not strictly limited by what the class can actually do, we can give the beastmaster any animal companion available in a published book. Included are some randomly-picked suggestions.

#### Dire Wolf
The enormous hound sticks loyally by the woman's heel, head down, fangs bared. Its eyes flick meaningfully to its master's face, reading her expression and relaxing when it sees that she's in a good mood.

#### Giant Scorpion
The clicking of its claws fades as its master strokes its head. "Not yet," the man says. "Knock them out first." And with that, the stinger shoots down.

#### Hunter Shark
The merfolk seems surprised to see a boat so far out to sea. He uncorks a potion to release a foul-smelling aroma, and in less than a minute, a fin emerges from the waters. A striped shark sidles up beside him, nudging him for food.

#### Tyrannosaurus Rex
The monster leaps across the plains, crossing the width of rivers in a single bound, shaking the foundations of the earth with every thunderous step. Clinging to its neck, hollering words of encouragement, is a little old lady gnome.

#### Quetzalcoatlus
The sky darkens and the usual lively sounds of birds chirping goes deadly silent. A single flap of the beast's wings sends the grass bouncing and dancing. With a gust strong enough to blow down a house, the beast lands in front of its master.

#### Aurochs
The young hill dwarf can barely hold on as the big-horned creature sprints at the side of the red barn. He hides his face just before he feels the crunch of splintering wood.

#### Goat
The ranger kneels down by her goat and lifts up its big floppy ear. She whispers, "If you don't stop eating random trash while we're supposed to be fighting off orcs, I'll take you to the market and trade you for a box of apples."
