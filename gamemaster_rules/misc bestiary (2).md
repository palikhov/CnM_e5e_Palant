## Arcana Priest

### Arcana Priest
Arcana priests reject the notion that divine and arcane magic are fundamentally different. They believe that magic, just as all things, come from the will of the gods and should be worshipped as such.

### Gods of the Arcana Priests

#### Azuth, God of Wizards
Followers find their homes piling up with books of arcane knowledge they have no recollection of acquiring.

#### Mystra, Goddess of Magic
Opposing magic always seems to just barely miss followers. They're just outside of the blast of a fireball, or the eldritch blast strikes their ally instead, or a paladin decides to use his words rather than a zone of truth.

#### Oghma, God of Knowledge
Followers are occasionally struck by facts they would have had no way of figuring out on their own.

## Arch Shepherd

### War Priest (PHB)
War priests view battlefields as sacred ground. While not soldiers themselves, they are often found among the ranks of armies, providing aid and bolstering the resolve of their allies to spur them into victory. Even a lost battle, and death at the hands of the enemy, is something to strive for in the eyes of a war priest.

### Gods of the War Priests
The war priest in Volo's Guide to Monsters is sufficient to represent this subclass.

#### Tempus, God of War
No follower has ever been caught at home when there's a fight to be had.

#### Nearly everyone has a story of the heroism of a dead follower they once knew.
bbb

#### Tyr, God of Justice
Followers are capable of coming to moral and ethical conclusions in a fraction of a second, and their decisions are almost always fair.

## Bandit Goon

Bandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.

Pirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.

## Bugbear Warchief

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

## Death Priest

### Death Priest (DMG)
Death priests worship foul gods. While some might intend to further the study of medicine and alleviate the suffering of those in need, most are drawn to this domain by the blackness in their hearts.

### Gods of the Death Priests

#### Bhaal, God of Murder
Followers must wipe their faces to remove the blood that periodically leaks from their eyes.

#### Kelemvor, God of the Dead
Out of the corner of one's eye, one can see, only through the reflection of a mirror, a skeletal apparition where the follower would be standing.

#### Loviatar, Goddess of Pain
Followers can withstand brutal torture without breaking a sweat.

#### Myrkul, God of Death
Followers are pale as a ghost.

#### Shar, Goddess of Darkness and Loss
Followers frequently seem to disappear into the shadows.

Followers are carriers and spreaders of countless debilitating diseases, yet suffer no symptoms themselves.

On a failed save, the paladin takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and the targeted creature takes the other half.

## Forge Priest

### Forge Priest (XGE)
A priest won't consider themselves worthy of the domain of the forge unless they have produced armor worthy of combat against demons and other creatures that would challenge the forward march of civilisation.

Many forge priests forgo the strongest aspects of divine magic in exchange for weapons and armor blessed by the gods.

## Knowledge Priest

### Knowledge Priest (PHB)
Knowledge priests took a liking to the studious nature of their profession rather than the martial responsibilities.

### Gods of the Knowledge Priests

#### Azuth, God of Wizards
Followers find their homes piling up with books of arcane knowledge they have no recollection of acquiring.

#### Deneir, God of Writing
Followers often carry a quill pen that never seems to run out of ink, and their packs are always filled with paper.

#### Gond, God of Craft
Followers suffer agonising dreams of others destroying their creations and live in constant paranoia when working on a project around others.

#### Mystra, Goddess of Magic
Opposing magic always seems to just barely miss followers. They're just outside of the blast of a fireball, or the eldritch blast strikes their ally instead, or a paladin decides to use his words rather than a zone of truth.

#### Oghma, God of Knowledge
Followers are occasionally struck by facts they would have had no way of figuring out on their own.

#### Savras, God of Divination and Fate
Keen observers know to avoid a room that a follower refuses to walk into.

#### Selune, Goddess of the Moon
In the waxing period, followers are exuberant, youthful, and optimistic. In the waning period, followers are mellow, dour, and pessimistic.

#### Waukeen, Goddess of Trade
There isn't a business deal in the known world that doesn't benefit a follower in some obscure, roundabout way.

## Malivar

Malivar Kresk is a Red Wizard of Thay, a conjurer, and recent apprentice to the treacherous Red Wizard named Morwena. Young, pale white, plain, and slender, Malivar usually hates his own appearance but hopes his red robes and smooth scalp give him a "lean and mean" look.

Now alone on his mission, Malivar doesn't hesitate to use or abuse the trust of others if it means he can get revenge, return to Thay alive, and report on Morwena's betrayal.

## Mercenary Envoy

These mercenaries stand for the Banner of Blades and the Iron Lions at Tyreus's fortress, but they might not be representative of those armies. These are rank-and-file warriors capable of demonstrating coordinated attacks and formations. They are neither the most capable lieutenants nor the rough-andtumble masses of these small armies.

For the purposes of their Inspired Courage feature, the mercenaries of both companies consider each other allies while at the fortress—unless the adventurers do something to drive them apart.

## Morwena Veilmist

Morwena Veilmist was a Red Wizard of Thay, but she was never loyal. She saw the Thayan wizards as a means to acquire power. When she met Tyreus, she thought she saw a new opportunity. She abandoned her old apprentice, Malivar, and joined Tyreus. She hoped she'd found a peer in the pursuit of power. She regrets her choice but remains devoted to her own success and no one else's. The lesson she chose to learn was never to trust anyone.

She is a tall, slender Chondathan woman with a severe hairstyle, kept short for simplicity's sake. She wears her fingernails short but sharp. She is a skilled, even cunning, player of dragonchess.

***Personality.*** "I read anything I can get my hands on. Most creatures aren't as smart as I am, so I talk down to people when I need them to keep up."

***Ideal.*** "Power. All things flow from personal power, and although I have little of it right now, I shall find new ways to attain and use power for the only person that matters to me: myself."

***Bond.*** "I've learned a valuable lesson about trusting people: don't. Other people may be of use to me, but I'm not putting myself in a position to be used again."

***Flaw.*** "I've let myself be fooled into trusting people, but no one is worth that risk. Only fools tell the whole truth."

## Tyreus, Illusionist

When he was young, living in the vast, internecine planar city of Ravnica, Tyreus's parents, Tyberio and Ayraea, forbade him from pursuing any study of magic or wizardry. They didn't want Tyreus embroiled in a life of danger and skullduggery—as was common in Ravnica. But Tyreus came to understand that at least part of his father's motive for forbidding magic was Tyberio's own rebellion against his adventurous parents. When he learned that his grandmother had once been a powerful mage, Tyreus wanted to follow in her footsteps.

***Power Hungry.*** Tyreus has always wanted to be distinctive, admired, and powerful. He saw magic as a way to achieve a greatness he felt Tyberio had tried to deny him. In secret, Tyreus sought out ways to learn magic, but as he was forced to hide his ambition and his studies, he found cohorts in the worst places. Evil mages stoked his hunger for power and eroded his conscience.

***Mundane Fury.*** Tyreus went months without speaking to his parents. Before he even knew they were sick, Tyberio and Ayraea passed away. Furious at his inability to help them—and their silent stubbornness—Tyreus sought the kind of power that would help him create places he could control. First, he studied the magic of illusions. He thought he could create illusions so real that he could live within them, fool others, and thus control his own destiny. Then he found another possibility.

***Selfish Pursuits.*** In journals Tyberio had hidden from him, written by Tyberio's mother, the wizard Sylvene, Tyreus found tales of the Stone of Creation, an artifact capable of creating places and structures seemingly from the imagination alone. Tyreus thus sought out everything he could learn about Sylvene and the Stone, leading him to another world—Faerûn—and the remote Highstar Lake, where the Stone was lost long ago.

#### Lost to Ambition
It may be too late for Tyreus. He has devoted himself to his own grandeur now and lost sight of why he wanted power in the first place. He doesn't want to help anyone but himself. He sees those who would help him or share in his ambitions as threats to his own power. He doesn't want approval or alliances; he wants subservience. Whether he realizes it or not, he doesn't care whom he hurts to get what he wants.

***Personality Traits.*** "I laugh to buy myself time to think, even though my gut instincts are often better than most people's calculated efforts."

***Ideals.*** "Power. People try to take things from me, to limit or deny me, but I don't allow it. Real power is deciding other people's fates."

***Bonds.*** "I'll make time for other people when I have a kingdom to call my own. Then I'll know who I can trust: the people who don't get in my way."

***Flaws.*** "I have a bad temper. Why can't people see I know what I'm doing?"
