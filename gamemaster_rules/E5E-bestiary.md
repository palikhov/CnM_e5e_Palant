# 5e SRD Features and Traits for Creating Creatures

## Introduction & How to Use
With Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, we are given a table of features or traits to add onto existing statblocks. There are already a lot of these scattered throughout the various books, so I have compiled the Traits, special Actions, special Reactions, and Legendary Actions from the SRD list of creatures. Some of them are nearly identical, some racial traits are obviously missing, while others were included because they existed in a statblock. I may add in Lair Actions and Regional Effects if I get time/ there is interest.

I have removed DC's and number of damage dice from most of these as they are typically based off of the rest of the statblock. Wherever these would be found in the document, they have been replaced with "##." Generally, a save DC is equal to (10 + HitDice/2 + CONmod) for physical effects and (10 + HitDice/2 + CHAmod) for innate magical abilities. Damage dice seem to be loosely based off of CR, but there is very little consistency. 

Pages 280-281 of the Dungeon Master's Guide has more information on which creatures these traits come from and how they affect the statblock. The creature that you are applying these options to is referred to throughout this document as *creature*, italicized, while a separate target will be simply labeled creature.

Coven features were excluded for now as special features that are a culmination of multiple fey casters.


### Traits
1. **Aberrant Ground.** The ground in a 10-foot radius around the *creature* is doughlike difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC ## Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.
2. **Acid Absorption.** Whenever the *creature* is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.
3. **Adhesive**. The *creature* adheres to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the *creature* is also grappled by it (escape DC ##). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
4. **Aggressive**. As a bonus action, the *creature* can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.
5. **Air Form.** The *creature* can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
6. **Ambusher**. In the first round of a combat, the *creature* has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it surprised.
7. **Amorphous**. The *creature* can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
8. **Amphibious**. The creature can breathe air and water.
9. **Angelic Weapons.** The *creature*'s weapon attacks are magical. When the *creature* hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra ##d8 radiant damage.
10. **Antimagic Susceptibility.** The *creature* is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the *creature* must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
11. **Assassinate.** During its first turn, the *creature* has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the *creature* scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.
12. **Aversion of Fire.** If the *creature* takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.
13. **Barbed Hide.** At the start of each of its turns, the *creature* deals (##d10) piercing damage to any creature grappling it.
14. **Beast of Burden.** The *creature* is considered to be a Large creature for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity.
15. **Berserk.** Whenever the *creature* starts its turn with ## hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the *creature* goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the *creature* attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the *creature* attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the *creature* goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.
16. **Blind Senses.** The *creature* can't use its blindsight while deafened and unable to smell.
17. **Blood Frenzy.** The *creature* has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.
18. **Bound.** The *creature* is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the *creature* and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet's wearer can telepathically call the *creature* to travel to it, and the *creature* knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the *creature* is within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded up) is transferred to the *creature*.
19. **Brave**. The *creature* has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
20. **Brute**. A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the *creature* hits with it (included in the attack).
21. **Charge.** If the *creature* moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra (##d6) damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC ## Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
22. **Charge**. If the *creature* moves at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a melee attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra (##d6) damage.
23. **Confer Fire Resistance.** The *creature* can grant resistance to fire damage to anyone riding it.

The target must succeed on a DC ## Constitution saving throw against this magic or die. If the target dies, the *creature* regains (##d6) hit points.
25. **Corrode Metal.** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the *creature* corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the *creature* is destroyed after dealing damage.
The *creature* can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.
26. **Corrosive Form.** A creature that touches the *creature* or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the *creature* corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the *creature* is destroyed after dealing damage.

29. **Dark Devotion.** The *creature* has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
30. **Deadly Leap.** If the *creature* jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC ## Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take (##d6 + STRmod) bludgeoning damage plus (##d6 + STRmod) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the *creature*'s space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the *creature*'s space.
31. **Death Burst.** When the *creature* dies, it explodes in a burst of dust. Each creature within 5 feet of it must then succeed on a DC ## Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
32. **Death Burst.** When the *creature* dies, it explodes in a burst of fire and magma.

36. **Death Throes.** When the *creature* dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC ## Dexterity saving throw, taking (##d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the *creature*'s weapons.
37. **Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the *creature*'s darkvision.
38. **Divine Awareness.** The *creature* knows if it hears a lie.
39. **Divine Eminence.** As a bonus action, the *creature* can expend a spell slot to cause its melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (3d6) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If the *creature* expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.
40. **Duergar Resilience.** The *creature* has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being charmed or paralyzed.

47. **Evasion**. If the *creature* is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the *creature* instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
48. **False Appearance.** While the *creature* remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a mundane object.
49. **Faultless Tracker.** The *creature* is given a quarry by its summoner. The *creature* knows the direction and distance to its quarry as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence. The *creature* also knows the location of its summoner.

53. **Fire Aura.** At the start of each of the *creature*'s turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes (##d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the *creature* or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes (##d6) fire damage.

The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction.

A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC ## Strength check against it.

91. **Misty Escape.** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the *creature* transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.
While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its *creature* form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.

The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.
93. **Multiple Heads.** The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.
Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.
At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.
94. **Nimble Escape.** The *creature* can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.
95. **Ooze Cube.** The *creature* takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the *creature*'s Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.
Creatures inside the *creature* can be seen but have total cover.
A creature within 5 feet of the *creature* can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the *creature*. Doing so requires a successful DC ## Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes  (##d6) acid damage.
The *creature* can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.
96. **Pack Tactics.** The *creature* has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the baboon's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
97. **Petrifying Gaze.** If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the *creature* and the two of them can see each other, the *creature* can force the creature to make a DC ## Constitution saving throw if the *creature* isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the *creature* until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the *creature* in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
98. **Pounce**. If the *creature* moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC ## Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

104. **Reflective Carapace.** Any time the *creature* is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the *creature* is unaffected. On a 6, the *creature* is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the *creature*, turning the caster into the target.
105. **Regeneration**. The *creature* regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the *creature* takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the *creature*'s next turn. The *creature* dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
106. **Regeneration**. The *creature* regains 10/20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the *creature* takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the *creature*'s next turn.
107. **Regeneration.** The *creature* regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.
108. **Rejuvenation**. A destroyed *creature* gains a new body in 24 hours if its heart is intact, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the *creature*'s heart.
109. **Rejuvenation**. If it dies, the *creature* returns to life in 1d6 days and regains all its hit points. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning.
110. **Rejuvenation**. If it has a phylactery, a destroyed *creature* gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.
111. **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the *creature* takes 7 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.
112. **Running Leap.** With a 10-foot running start, the *creature* can long jump up to 25 feet.

114. **Siege Monster.** The *creature* deals double damage to objects and structures.

While in mist form, the *creature* can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

3. **Animate Trees (1/Day).** The *creature* magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a *creature*, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the *creature*. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the *creature* dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the *creature* takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.
4. **Antennae**. The *creature* corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the *creature*'s touch.
If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, its takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.
5. **Blinding Breath (Recharge 6).** The *creature* exhales a ##-foot cone of blinding dust. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC ## Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
6. **Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5–6).** The *creature* spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact.

8. **Change Shape.** The *creature* magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the *creature*'s choice).
In a new form, the *creature* retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the *creature* can use its bite in that form.
9. **Change Shape.** The *creature* magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid, into a Large giant, or back into its true form. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. The only equipment that is transformed is its glaive, which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form. If the *creature* dies, it reverts to its true form, and its glaive reverts to its normal size.
10. **Charm**. One humanoid the *creature* can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the *creature*'s verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this *creature*'s Charm for the next 24 hours.
The *creature* can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.
11. **Charm**. The *creature* targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the *creature*, the target must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the *creature*. The charmed target regards the *creature* as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the *creature*'s control, it takes the *creature*'s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the *creature*'s bite attack.
Each time the *creature* or the *creature*'s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the *creature* is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.
12. **Children of the Night (1/Day).** The *creature* magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the *creature* can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the *creature* and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the *creature* dies, or until the *creature* dismisses them as a bonus action.

\pagebreak

13. **Create Specter.** The *creature* targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently.

The *creature* can have no more than seven specters under its control at one time.
14. **Create Whirlwind.** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the *creature* can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the *creature* maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the *creature* that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC ## Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The *creature* can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the *creature* loses sight of it.
\
A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC ## Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
15. **Darkness Aura (1/Day).** A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the *creature*, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the *creature* maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.
16. **Death Glare.** The *creature* targets one frightened creature it can see within 30 feet. If the target can see the *creature*, it must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.

The target must make a DC ## Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking (##d10 + CHAmod) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
18. **Dreadful Glare.** The *creature* targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the *creature*, it must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the *creature*'s next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all creatures for the next 24 hours.
19. **Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the *creature* magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the *creature*is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the *creature*lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.
20. **Enslave (3/Day)**. The *creature* targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the *creature* until the *creature* dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the *creature*'s control and can't take reactions, and the *creature* and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.
\
Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the *creature*.
22. **Ethereal Stride.** The *creature* and up to three willing creatures within 5 feet of it magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.
23. **Etherealness.** The *creature* magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.
24. **Engulf**. The *creature* engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC ## Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or take (##d8 + STRMOD) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
25. **Engulf**. The *creature* moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the *creature* enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC ## Dexterity saving throw.
On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the *creature*. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.
\
On a failed save, the *creature* enters the creature's space, and the creature takes (##d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes (##d6) acid damage at the start of each of the *creature*'s turns. When the *creature* moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.
\
An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC ## Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the *creature*.
26. **Fetid Cloud (1/Day).** A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the *creature*. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC ## Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.

\pagebreak

26. **Fey Charm.** The *creature* targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the *creature*, it must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the *creature* as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the *creature*'s control, it takes the *creature*'s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.
Each time the *creature* or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the *creature* dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the *creature*'s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.
\
The *creature* can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.
28. **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The *creature* exhales fire in a ##-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC ## Dexterity saving throw, taking (##d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
29. **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The *creature* exhales fire in a ##-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC ## Dexterity saving throw, taking (##d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC ## Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
32. **Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the *creature*'s choice that is within 120 feet of the *creature* and aware of it must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the *creature*'s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
33. **Frost Breath (Recharge 6).** The *creature* exhales a ##-foot cone of cold air. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC ## Dexterity saving throw, taking (##d4) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

36. **Heart Sight.** The *creature* touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC ## Charisma saving throw, the *creature* also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.
37. **Horrific Appearance.** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the *creature* and can see the *creature*'s true form must make a DC ## Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the *creature* is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the *creature*'s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.
Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the *creature*'s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the *creature*.
38. **Horrifying Visage**. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the *creature* that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this *creature*'s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
38. **Horror Nimbus (Recharge 5–6).** The *creature* magically emits scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the *creature* that can see the light must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the *creature*'s Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.
39. **Illusory Appearance.** The *creature* covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the *creature* takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the *creature* could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching it would feel rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC ## Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the *creature* is disguised.
40. **Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. A 20-foot-radius cloud of ink extends all around the *creature* if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the *creature* can use the Dash action as a bonus action.


\pagebreak

41. **Invisibility.** The *creature* magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the *creature* wears or carries is invisible with it.
42. **Invisible Passage.** The *creature* magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, it leaves no physical evidence of its passage, so it can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment it wears or carries is invisible with her.
43. **Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the *creature* can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the *creature*. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the *creature* is incapacitated.
44. **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The *creature* exhales lightning in a ##-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC ## Dexterity saving throw, taking (##d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
45. **Lightning Storm.** The *creature* magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the *creature* can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC ## Dexterity saving throw, taking (##d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
46. **Lightning Strike (Recharge 5–6).** The giant hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC ## Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (##d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
47. **Luring Song.** The *creature* sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the *creature* that can hear the song must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The *creature* must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the *creature* is incapacitated.
\
While charmed by the *creature*, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other creatures. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the *creature*, the target must move on its turn toward the *creature* by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the *creature*, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
\
A target that successfully saves is immune to this *creature*'s song for the next 24 hours.
49. **Moan**. Each creature within 60 feet of the *creature* that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC ## Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the *creature*'s next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the *creature*'s moan for the next 24 hours.
50. **Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).** While on the Ethereal Plane, the *creature* magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by (##d10). The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
51. **Paralyzing Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The *creature* exhales paralyzing gas in a ##-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC ## Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
52. **Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The *creature* exhales petrifying gas in a ##-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC ## Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
53. **Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The *creature* magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which *creature* is the real one. If the *creature* is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.
\
Whenever any creature targets the *creature* with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the *creature* or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.
\
A duplicate has the *creature*'s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

\pagebreak

54. **Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The *creature* exhales poisonous gas in a ##-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC ## Constitution saving throw, taking (##d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
55. **Possession (Recharge 6).** One humanoid that the *creature* can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC ## Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the *creature*; the *creature* then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The *creature* now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The *creature* can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
\
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the *creature* ends it as a bonus action, or the *creature* is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the *creature* reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this *creature*'s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
56. **Read Thoughts.** The *creature* magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the *creature* can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the *creature*'s concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell).

In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.
64. **Spores (Recharge 6).** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the *creature*. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC ## Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes (##d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.

\
When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated.

Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC ## Constitution saving throw, taking (##d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the *creature*'s space.
\
The *creature* can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the *creature*'s turns, each target grappled by it takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

76. **Whirlwind (Recharge 4–6).** Each creature in the *creature*'s space must make a DC ## Strength saving throw.

If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC ## Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.

3. The *creature* casts phantasmal force (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the *creature* can't take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the *creature*'s phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.
3. The *creature* chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success.

Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the *creature* uses this lair action again or when the *creature* dies.
3. The *creature* creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
4. The *creature* glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
5. The *creature* rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.

On a failed save, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted.
6. Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the *creature* can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn.

The copy can appear at any location the *creature* has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the *creature* can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the *creature* maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the *creature*. The *creature* can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.
2. Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the *creature*'s lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil creatures are near the *creature* or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.
3. Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the *creature*'s lair.
4. Creatures native to the *creature*'s domain have an easier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
5. Curses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed.
5. Divination spells cast within the lair by creatures other than the *creature* have a 25 percent chance to provide misleading results, as determined by the DM. If a divination spell already has a chance to fail or become unreliable when cast multiple times, that chance increases by 25 percent.
2. Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).
3. Food instantly molders and water instantly evaporates when brought into the lair. Other non magical drinks are spoiled - wine turning to vinegar, for instance.
2. Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.
3. Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the *creature*'s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the *creature* is at rest.
3. Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.
4. Given days or longer to work, the *creature* can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.
3. Hidden sinkholes form in and around the *creature*'s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.
4. Icy walls block off areas in the *creature*'s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If the *creature* wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the *creature* moves through is destroyed, however.
2. Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.
3. Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.
3. Magic carvings of the *creature*'s smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the *creature*'s lair.
4. Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.
5. Once per day, the *creature* can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The *creature* doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
6. Open flames of a non magical nature are extinguished within the *creature*'s domain. Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected.

\pagebreak


24. Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.
5. Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair serve as the *creature*'s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.
6. Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.
6. Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the *creature*'s lair.
7. The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become 1d20 years older or younger (the sphinx's choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A greater restoration spell can restore a creature's age to normal.
7. The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair must reroll initiative. The sphinx can choose not to reroll.
8. The flow of time within the lair is altered such that everything within moves up to 10 years forward or backward (sphinx's choice). Only the sphinx is immediately aware of the time change. A wish spell can return the caster and up to seven other creatures designated by the caster to their normal time.
9. The sphinx shifts itself and up to seven other creatures it can see within in its lair to another plane of existence. Once outside its lair, the sphinx can't use lair actions, but it can return to its lair as a bonus action on its turn, taking up to seven creatures with it.
3. The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.
4. There's a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.
5. Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the 'thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.
3. Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
4. Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair. These creatures speak well of the *creature*, but can't divulge its whereabouts.
4. Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the *creature*'s lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the *creature* prefers to remain undisturbed.
4. Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.
5. Underwater plants within 6 miles of the *creature*'s lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.
6. Water elementals coalesce within 6 miles of the lair. These elementals can't leave the water and have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 (-5).
3. Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the *creature* that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.
4. Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
5. When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the maximum number of hit points possible for the spell or effect.
4. Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the *creature*'s lair, the *creature* can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the *creature* upon waking.
4. Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the *creature*'s lair, the *creature* becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.
5. Within its lair, the *creature* can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.
6. Within 1 mile of its lair, the *creature* leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the *creature*'s path.
7. Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the *creature*'s or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.

## Additional Monster Features
The "Creating a Monster" section of the DMG includes guidelines regarding Challenge Rating calculations and how to make monsters, including step-by-step instructions for monster creation, as well as multiple lists of generic features to be used by monsters and NPCs alike.

This section builds off of this DMG content by making suggestions as to what generic features certain monsters could get based on their role and tier. Note that the features mentioned in this section all have the potential to increase a monster's Challenge Rating, as discussed in the previous section.

Additionally, note that the features discussed in this section aren't exclusive to a given role. When a monster has two or more overlaping roles, it is appropriate to give it features that are associated with any of those roles. Even when this overlap isn't present, it is reasonable to use a "mismatching" feature if it can be justified via flavor. For example, the Limited Flight ability below might be usable to represent a flying skirmisher instead of a controller. Rather than being rigid categories, you can treat each collection of features as fluid recommendations that purely depend on the flavor of your monster.

\pagebreakNum

### Brutes
The Aggressive, Brute, Charge, Rampage, Reckless, Relentless, and Siege Monster features are all appropriate for brutish monsters. In addition, consider using any of the following features to round out your brutes.

***Brawler.*** The monster can use its bonus action to attempt to grapple or shove a creature within its reach.

***Brutish Durability.*** Whenever the monster makes a saving throw, it can roll a d6 and add the result to its saving throw total.

***Improvised Attack.*** The monster can replace any of its attacks with an unorthodox attempt to bash with or throw an object within its reach. The attack's normal and long ranges are determined based on the size of the monster, and the attack's damage dice is one size smaller than the melee attack it normally uses on its turn (e.g. if most of its attacks have dice of about 2d6, this attack's dice will be 2d4).

***Shrug it Off.*** The monster can use its reaction to halve the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The monster must be able to see the attacker.

***Survivor.*** The monster regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point but fewer hit points than half its hit point maximum.

***Unyielding.*** As a reaction when the monster is subjected to an effect that would move it, knock it prone, or both, it can choose to be neither moved nor knocked prone.

### Controllers
The Charm, Illusory Appearance, Invisibility, and Mimicry features are all appropriate for controllers, although they tend to be used in tandem with other controller-esque spells and abilities. With this in mind, consider using any of the following features to round out your controllers.

***Aura of Mind Erosion.*** Any hostile creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the monster must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC is Intelligence-based). On a failed save, a creature suffers disadvantage on all Wisdom and Charisma saving throws until the start of the monster's next turn.

***Broken Will (Action).*** The monster targets one creature it can communicate with via telepathy. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC is Intelligence-based). On a failed save, the monster chooses the target's movement and action on its next turn. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being charmed.

***Captivating Presence.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the monster must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC is Charisma-based). On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed by the monster for 1 minute or until the creature is farther than 30 feet away from it. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to the monster's Captivating Presence for 24 hours.

***Limited Flight.*** The monster can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed equal to its walking speed until the end of the turn.

***Redirect Attack.*** As a reaction when a creature the monster can see targets it with an attack, the monster chooses an ally within 5 feet of it. The two creatures swap places, and the chosen ally becomes the target instead.

***Stunning Gaze (Action).*** The monster targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC is Charisma-based) or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

### Skirmishers
Ambusher, Cunning Action, Elusive, Evasion, Flyby, Invisibility, Nimble Escape, Pack Tactics, Shadow Stealth, Sneak Attack, Surprise Attack, and Uncanny Dodge are all features (either rogue class features or generic monster features) that are fitting for skirmishers. In addition, consider using any of the following features to round out your skirmishers.

***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, the monster has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the monster scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Lightfooted.*** The monster can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

***Lurker in Shadow.*** While in darkness, the monser is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness.

***Mobile.*** When the monster makes a melee attack against a creature, it doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether it hits or not.

***Shroud Self (Action).*** The monster magically turns invisible until the start of its next turn. This invisibility ends if the monster makes an attack roll, makes a damage roll, or casts a spell.

***Skirmisher.*** As a reaction when a creature misses a melee attack against the monster, or if a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of the monster, the monster can move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Snipers
Many of the stealth-based features that skirmishers get can be appropriate for snipers, but not all of them are appropriate for non-stealthy snipers. Consider using any of the following features to round out your snipers:

***Aim.*** As a bonus action, the monster can add 1d10 to its next attack or damage roll with a ranged attack.

***Focus.*** As a bonus action, the monster can target a creature it can see within 120 feet of it and make that creature its focus. The target remains the monster's focus for 1 minute, or until either the target or the monster drops to 0 hit points. The monster can add 1d4 to attack and damage rolls against the target.

***Sharpshooter.*** The monster's ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

### Soldiers
Soldiers are generic enemies of any type (although many of them are melee-centric), so there are no specific feature recommendations for it.

\pagebreakNum

### Strikers
The Aggressive, Blood Frenzy, Martial Advantage, and Reckless features are all appropriate for strikers. In addition, consider any of the following features to round out your strikers.

***Action Surge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The monster can take an extra action on its turn.

***Arcane Advantage (1/Turn).*** The monster can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature it hits with a damaging spell attack if that target is within 5 feet of an ally of the monster and that ally isn't incapacitated.

***Guided Strike (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the monster makes an attack roll, the monster can use its reaction to add a +10 bonus to that roll.

***Improved Critical.*** The monster's weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

***Potent Spellcasting.*** The monster can add its spellcasting ability modifier to the damage it deals with any cantrip.

***War Magic.*** When the monster uses its action to cast a spell, it can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Leaders
My [Warlord Collection](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LtrZrYqZl6TBt8gu9lt) document includes a list of possible features a leader-type monster can be given, some of which are reprinted below. While the pregenerated monsters in this document all have legendary actions, keep in mind that they aren't a requirement for all leaders.

***Battlefield Inspiration.*** Themonster chooses up to three allies it can see within 30 feet of it. Until the end of the monster's next turn, each target can add a d4 to its attack rolls and saving throws.

***Bulwark (3/Day).*** As a reaction when an ally within 30 feet of the warlord fails a saving throw, the ally can reroll the saving throw.

***Command Ally.*** As a bonus action, the monster targets one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. If the ally can see and hear the monster, it can make one weapon attack as a reaction and gains advantage on the attack roll.

***Leadership (Action; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the monster can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the monster. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the monster is incapacitated.

***Rallying Cry.*** The monster chooses one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. If the ally can see or hear the monster, it gains temporary hit points equal to the monster's Challenge Rating plus its Charisma modifier. If the ally is currently charmed or frightened, those effects immediately ends on itself.

***Tactical Maneuver.*** As a bonus action, the monster targets one monster it can see within 60 feet of it. If the ally can see and hear the monster, it can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

## Creating a Boss Fight
In D&D and fiction as a whole, the concept of an epic showdown against a powerful boss monster is universal. Before making entirely new homebrew mechanics for these boss monsters, let's first discuss the options that already exist, and expand upon them as needed.

### Reactions
Reactions are a basic action option available to all creatures, allowing them to create some sort of effect in response to a given trigger. By default, the only at-will reaction the monster has is to make an opportunity attack. However, it is very easy to take existing reactions from official monsters (e.g. Parry) and to add them to a custom monster as appropriate.

Consider using the following traits to enhance a monster's capability to use reactions.

***Fast Reflexes.*** When the monster takes a reaction, it can also move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Legendary Reaction.*** The monster can spend one legendary action to take a reaction, even when it has already used its normal reaction.

***Limited Reactiveness.*** The monster can take two reactions per round in combat.

***Reactive.*** The monster can take one reaction on every turn in combat.

### Legendary Resistances
Legendary Resistances are given to many legendary monsters to prevent them from being gibbed by a "save or suck" ability, such as the *hold monster* spell or the Stunning Strike monk feature. On one hand, this mechanic can prevent a boss fight from being ended prematurely by an unlucky saving throw against a powerful effect. On the other hand, some DMs find this mechanic to be boring and/or unfair to their players. If so, consider the following alternatives:

***Break Free.*** If the monster is incapacitated at the start of its turn, the effect causing this condition immediately ends on the monster, and the monster takes damage equal to its Challenge Rating.

***Freedom of Action.*** The monster has advantage on saving throws against effects that would restrain or incapacitat it.

***Freedom of Movement.*** The monster ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.

***Indomitable (3/Day).*** The monster can reroll a saving throw it fails. It must use the new roll.

***Legendary Durability (1/Turn).*** The monster can choose to halve the damage it takes from an effect it can see.

***Legendary Protection.*** If the monster fails a saving throw, it can spend one legendary action to succeed instead.

***Legendary Resistance (1/Round).*** If the monster fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Unbreakable (3/Day).*** If the monster is incapacitated at the start of its turn, the effect causing this condition immediately ends on the monster.

\pagebreakNum

### Lair Actions
To make certain fights more epic and cool, you can give your monsters access to lair actions. Lair actions are special powers that certain monsters can use to manipulate the lair they reside in. For example, an ancient red dragon can cause magma and volcanic gases to erupt within its lair, while Orcus can cause corpses within the lair to animate as undead. Not only do these powers add to the presentation of the fight, but they also influence the action economy by allowing a monster that has them to do more from round to round.

That said, just like legendary actions (see below), lair actions needn't be restricted to boss fights, high CR monsters, or even to lairs in general. For example, the lair action system can be used to quantify the spread of fire due to a rampaging squad of rogue fire elementals, which lacks all three of these qualities. In other cases, you can even just have environmental shifts (e.g. the effects of a natural earthquake) occur on initiative count 20 of each round, which is the equivalent of a lair action that isn't even taken by a monster at all.

The "lair actions without a lair" concept might sound strange at first, but can actually be used quite well in boss fights and other climactic scenarios. Many official monsters have lair actions that don't necessarily manipulate their lair itself; for example, both of Zariel's lair actions boil down to her casting some sort of spell. While the lack of a lair dependency is arguably a form of bad design (an argument I won't disagree with), this independence also allows you to use these lair actions even when it is outside of its lair or it doesn't have a lair in the first place. Remember that while this might work for some monsters, it might not work with the ones that directly manipulate their lair via their lair actions.

___
In general, whenever a monster uses a lair action, one or more of the following effects can occur:
- The monster causes the lair to shift and transform, such as destroying all its exits or erecting a new wall.
- A hazardous terrain feature in the lair is activated or takes effect.
- The monster grants its allies some sort of buff or allows them to take some sort of an additional action.
- One spell or effect on the monster immediately ends.
- The monster creates or summons new allies to fight alongside it.
- All hostile creatures in the lair suffer some sort of detrimental condition (save resists).
- The monster casts an innate spell that is often (but not always) incapable of dealing damage.
- The effects of an ongoing ritual take place.

___
Additionally, consider using the following ability to enhance a monster's capability to use lair actions.

___
- **Manipulate Lair (Costs 2 Legendary Actions).** On initiative count 10 (losing initiative ties), the monster takes a lair action.

\columnbreak

### Legendary Actions
Legendary actions are special abilities that some monsters can use outside of their normal turn in combat. They have a set number of legendary actions per round, and they can spend them on various effects that interupt the normal initiative order.

Legendary actions are typically used to balance out the action economy when a boss-like monster is alone in their fight against the adventuring party. However, even if a monster is of a low CR and is not strong relative to other legendary creatures in the world, giving them legendary actions can still make the fight against them that much more fun and challenging.

When designing legendary actions for your monsters, keep the following tips in mind:

***Balance them Out.*** Remember that the damage dealt by a monster's legendary actions contributes to their total damage per round. This can stack up quickly, so try not to make a legendary action that is both spammable and powerful. Furthermore, note that most monsters have three legendary actions per round, but some extraordinarily powerful monsters (e.g. Tiamat) can have five of them.

***Add Variety.*** If a monster just repeats the same attack three times using their legendary actions, then what's the point of having them at all? As legendary actions can be used whenever a creature ends its turn, they should be designed in a way that allows certain actions to be used in certain situations. For example, many creatures often have a legendary action that lets them move, which can be used to reposition, to retreat when in a bad situation, or to give chase when in a good situation. The use of this legendary action must be weighed against the other options: for example, an Attack legendary action that will increase their offensive power accordingly.

***Differ the Costs.*** While it is okay to have a monster who uses each of their legendary actions one at a time, another way to add variety is to create options that cost multiple legendary actions to use. This allows for powerful abilities to be used outside of a monster's turn without allowing them to be spammed repeatedly. For example, you might give a spellcaster the ability to Cast a Spell as a legendary action, but using this ability would cost two legendary actions at once. The most extreme situations involve powers that cost three legendary actions at once, which typically a monster's entire budget per round. 

Remember that while these costly abilities should be more powerful than the others, they shouldn't necessarily be the best choice in all situations. While some abilities might be considered the "default" options, they should all be comparable enough where choosing between them involves some sort of opportunity cost.

***Stay Organized.*** Legendary actions aren't just sorted alphabetically. All options are sorted in an ascending manner based on how many legendary actions they cost, and within each tier, they are sorted alphabetically. Then, utility legendary actions such as Detect, Move, and Use an Object that don't have any direct offensive or defensive power are moved to the top, unless such options cost more than one legendary actions.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;***Customize your Options.*** Not all monsters will have the same type of legendary actions. Some legendary actions will enable them to enter melee range and to smash their foes into the ground. Others will boost their defensive power of both themselves and their allies. A few of them even let a monster teleport across the battlefield and activate powerful magical or psionic abilities.

You should customize a monster's legendary actions based on their role in combat. Below are a few example legendary actions that you can use for each role.

#### Soldiers
The legendary actions listed below are all generic enough to be used by any type of monster.

___
- **Detect.** The monster makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Move.** The monster moves up to its speed.
- **Use an Object.** The monster takes the Use an Object action.
- **Attack.** The monster makes one weapon attack.
- **At-Will Spell.** The monster casts one of its at-will spells.
- **Tustle.** The monster attempts to grapple or shove one creature within its reach.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster casts a spell.
- **Magic Item (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster activates a magic item.
- **Psionics (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster activates a psionic power.
- **Recharge (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster recharges one of its actions and uses it.

#### Brutes
Brutes tend to have legendary actions that compliment their raw strength or savagery.

___
- **Destroy.** The monster makes a melee attack against an object or structure.
- **Charge (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster moves up to its speed in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature or object that is smaller than itself. The first time it enters a creature or object's space during this move, the target must succeed on a DC Strength saving throw (DC is Strength-based) or take bludgeoning damage equal to the monster's Strength score and be pushed ahead of the monster for the rest of this move.
- **Savage (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster makes a melee attack against each creature and object within its reach.
- **Smash (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster makes a melee attack against a creature within its reach. On a hit, the target must also make a Constitution saving throw (DC is Strength-based). On a failed save, the target is stunned until the end of the monster's next turn.
- **Swat Away (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC Strength saving throw (DC is Strength-based) or be pushed 15 feet in a straight line away from the monster. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target also falls prone.

\columnbreak

#### Controllers
Controllers tend to have legendary actions that disable or weaken their foes rather than doing direct damage.

___
- **Inflict Condition.** The monster targets one creature within 60 feet of it that it can see. The target must succeed on a saving throw or suffer one condition until the end of the monster's next turn. The DC and type of the saving throw, the condition inflicted, and the range of the ability are all determined by the monster's specific abilities and the ability score they are derived from.
- **Thrall.** The monster targets one creature within 60 feet that is charmed or frightened by the monster; that target must make a Charisma saving throw (DC is Charisma-based). On a failed save, the monster decides how the target acts during its next turn, as long as the target's behavior is consistent with the effects of the condition(s) it is suffering from.
- **Utility Power.** The monster casts a spell or activates a psionic power. The ability used must not be capable of dealing damage.
- **Reposition (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster targets two creatures within 60 feet of it. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to avoid this effect (DC is Intelligence-based). Each affected target is teleported to a different unoccupied space that the monster can see within 60 feet of it. That space must be on the ground or on a floor.
- **Weaken (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster targets one creature within 60 feet of it that it can see. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC is Charisma-based) or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the end of the monster's next turn.

#### Leaders
My [Warlord Collection](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LtrZrYqZl6TBt8gu9lt) document includes a list of possible legendary actions a leader-type monster can be given.

#### Skirmishers
Skirmishers tend to have legendary actions that allow them to weave in and out of combat.

___
- **Quick Step.** The monster moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Teleport.** The monster teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
- **Stealth Shot.** The monster makes a ranged weapon attack. If the monster was hidden, this attack doesn't reveal the monster's exact position, but it does reveal the general direction that the monster can be found in.
- **Step from Sight (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster moves up to half its speed, and is invisible during this movement. If the conditions are met, it can take the Hide action at the end of the move.
- **Backup Plan (Costs 3 Actions).** The monster casts the *invisibility* spell on itself. It then moves up to its speed.

\pagebreakNum

#### Snipers
Snipers tend to have legendary actions that enable them to focus on one enemy in particular.

___
- **Crippling Shot.** The monster makes a ranged attack against a creature. On a hit, the target also has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of the monster's next turn.
- **Disarming Strike.** The monster makes a ranged attack against a creature. On a hit, the target must make a Strength saving throw (DC is Dexterity-based). On a failed save, it drops one object of the monster's choice. The object lands at the target's feet.
- **Seeking Shot.** The monster makes a ranged attack against one creature it knows the exact location of, even if it can't see it. The projectile flies towards the target, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the attack's range and there is a path large enough for the projectile to travel to the target, the attack roll is made with advantage. Otherwise, the attack misses.
- **Sniper's Ire.** The monster targets one creature it can see within 90 feet of it. The monster has advantage on ranged attack rolls against the target until the end of the monster's next turn.
- **Vulnerable Target.** The monster makes a ranged attack against a creature that is incapacitated. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 7 (2d6) damage.

#### Strikers
Strikers tend to have high damage legendary actions, but they might also have non-damaging alternatives that are used to compliment their exact lore and flavor.

___
- **Critical Strike.** The monster makes an attack against one target. If the attack hits and some condition is met, the attack becomes a critical hit.
- **Dash Attack.** The monster moves up to half its speed and makes one attack.
- **Blitz (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. It can make one melee attack against each creature it moves past.
- **Curse (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster magically curses one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The cursed creature gains vulnerability to all damage dealt by the monster until the end of the monster's next turn.
- **Rapid Assault (Costs 3 Actions).** The monster makes three attacks against one target. The monster gains advantage on the attack rolls if some condition has been met (e.g. the target is incapacitated).

### Mythic Traits and Actions
The official setting book Mythic Odysseys of Theros introduced mythic monsters, which are a tier above legendary actions. This mechanic prevents a monster from dying at 0 hit points - instead, they effectively regain all of their hit points and gain access to powerful new legendary action options called mythic actions. A mythic monster thus counts as two distinct monsters of its Challenge Rating for the purpose of encounter balancing and experience rewards.

Personally, I think this is a great addition to 5e. It is elegant, flexible, and very effective at what it is trying to do. In fact, I even made my own mythic monster in my [Elder Evils 5e](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LNa95CLcSwIUPkRniO3#p28) conversion as soon as I learned how they work.

#### Breakdown
Mythic monsters have two key components: a mythic trait, and mythic actions that are associated with it.

A mythic trait that details the monster's optional "second phase". Instead of dying at 0 HP, it regains all of its hit points, or it otherwise triggers a mechanic that grants them that many effecitve hit points. This also leaves room for the monster to immediately take some sort of movement and/or action. This trait typically recharges after a short or long rest, but might not recharge at all if it is a permanent transformation.

With this mythic trait comes a list of mythic actions. Mythic actions are new legendary action options that the monster gains access to once their mythic trait is triggered. These legendary actions are generally more powerful than their old ones, but they still retain access to their old ones if needed. Mythic actions are typically available for 1 hour after the mythic trait is triggered, but this can be changed to fit a particular monster's circumstances.

#### Variants
Here are some variants of this system that you can use for your mythic monsters.

***Traits and Actions.*** In addition to gaining new legendary actions, you can also give a mythic monster access to new traits and abilities when their mythic trait is active. For example, if you want to give a monster Limited Magic Immunity during its second phase, you can label this trait as "Limited Magic Immunity (Mythic Form Only)". If you want a monster to lose access to a feature, such as a Frightful Presence action, you can instead label it as "Frightful Presence (Original Form Only)". This notation is similar to features that are restricted to a shapechanger's specific forms, such as those of a werewolf.

***Extra Action Slots.*** You can also grant a mythic monster an extra action on its turn each round called a "mythic maneuver". Note that this extra action might be oppressive if it isn't heavily restricted. I would personally recommend restricting this maneuver to be strictly utility-based (e.g. the Dash or Disengage action), but if proper restrictions are applied, damage-based abilities should be fine as well (e.g. one weapon attack only).

A similar concept applies to reactions: you can grant the monster an additional reaction slot, or access to a trait like Reactive, while its mythic trait is active.

***Multiple Transformations.*** Want to have a monster with more than just two phases? Label its mythic trait with multiple uses per day, and that's all you need to do. That said, such a monster will be much stronger than a normal mythic monster, which is already very strong compared to a normal legendary monster. With this in mind, perhaps the monster's transformations shouldn't restore all of its hit points, or perhaps the monster should have less hit points to begin with.

\pagebreakNum

#### Generic Mythic Traits
Here are some mythic traits you can copy or build off of to create your own mythic monsters.

***Basic Mythic Monster (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the monster is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains all of its hit points.

***Exposed Weak Points (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the monster is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, the damage reveals the monster's four weak points. A weak point shares the monster's AC and has a quarter of its hit point maximum. It also shares the monster's damage vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities, and it is immune to all conditions. If it is forced to make a saving throw, treat its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the monster finishes a short or long rest, the monster heals, any destroyed weak points regenerate, and the weak points are covered again. The monster dies when all of its weak points are destroyed.

***Permanent Transformation (Mythic Trait).*** If the monster is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains all of its hit points, and it permanently transforms into a second form. This form is immune to all conditions, has advantage on all saving throws, and deals an additional 7 (2d6) damage whenever it hits with a weapon attack. Otherwise, this form uses the monster's normal statistics.

***Punishing Transformation (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the monster is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains all of its hit points, it recharges all of its actions, it moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and it makes one weapon attack against the creature that reduced it to 0 hit points, if possible.

***Limited Rejuvenation (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the monster dies, its body reforms at the start of its next turn, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again.

***Multi-Stage Fight (Mythic Trait; 2/Day).*** If the monster is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains all of its hit points, and it regains one spell slot of 8th level or lower, as well as one use of its Legendary Resistance feature.

#### Extra Features
The traits and abilities below are examples of other features you can use tohook into the mythic monster system.

***Mythic Fury.*** If the monster's mythic trait is active, the number of legendary actions it can take each round increases by 1 for 1 hour after using it.

***Mythic Maneuver.*** While the monster's mythic trait is active, it gains an additional action it can use on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, Search, or Use an Object action.

***Mythic Reaction.*** While the monster's mythic trait is active, it gains a special reaction that it can take once per round. The monster can't use this special reaction on the same turn that it takes its normal reaction.

***Variable Resistance.*** While the monster's mythic trait is active, it gains resistance to one damage type of its choice for 1 hour after using it.

\pagebreak

#### Artificer
Artificers are tricky because they are inherently tied to magic items, which are something most monsters don't have. That said, infusions vanish from an item at least one day after the monster's death, allowing you to give an artificer monster items without fear of your players getting their hands on them.

***Foundation of Knowledge.*** The monster can cast spells of 1st level at will, without expending a spell slot.

***Improvised Action.*** On each of its turns, the monster can use a bonus action to take the Help, Search, or Use an Object action.

***Magical Genius.*** As an action, the monster can roll a d4 and regain a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.

***Retooled Spell.*** When the monster casts a spell that deals damage, it can change the spell's damage to cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder.

***Spell Versatility (Recharge 5-6).*** At the start of its turn, the monster can immediately swap one of its prepared spells for another spell on the artificer spell list.

\columnbreak

#### Barbarian
Barbarians are easy to represent due to their straightforward manner of attacking. To reach higher CRs, they can be given damage resistances and other forms of damage mitigation that are adequately explained by their Rage feature.

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the monster hits with it (included in the attack).

***Deadly Critical.*** The monster scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 and rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.

***Rage.*** In combat, the monster is raging while it isn't incapacitated. While raging, the monster has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it deals one extra die of damage when it hits with a melee weapon attack.

***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the monster can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

***Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the monster takes damage that is equal to or less than 10 + its Constitution modifier that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

#### Bard
Bards can easily be represented through their spells, music, and skill proficiencies (including Expertise). Beyond that, any features you give a bardic monster should relate to their Bardic Inspiration or should be usable on top of their spellcasting.

***Bardic Inspiration (Recharge 4-6).*** As a bonus action, the monster chooses one creature within 60 feet of it that can hear the monster. Once within the next 10 minutes, the target can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.

***Combat Inspiration.*** While the monster isn't incapacitated and can play its music, allies within 30 feet of the monster that can hear the monster have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

***Countercharm.*** While the monster isn't incapacitated and can play its music, the monster and any ally within 60 feet of it that can hear the monster has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

***Mantle of Inspiration.*** At the start of each of the monster's turns, each ally that can hear the monster gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + the monster's Charisma modifier. This ability doesn't function while the monster is incapacitated or otherwise can't play its music.

***Taunt (2/Day).*** The bard can use a bonus action on its turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC is Charisma-based) or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next turn.

\pagebreakNum

#### Cleric
As clerics gain most of their power from their Divine Domains, it's easy enough to represent the base class through spellcasting and some other features as appropriate. In particular, Channel Divinities can be represented as individual short rest abilities or as recharge abilities rather than costing a resource.

***Divine Eminence.*** As a bonus action, the monster can expend a spell slot to cause its melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (3d6) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If the monster expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

***Divine Intervention (1/Week).*** The monster calls upon the aid of a deity or some other divine power. Roll a d100. If the number rolled is equal to or lower than the monster's virtual cleric level, the divine power intervenes by duplicating the effects of some spell. The spell normally must be 6th level or lower, but can be higher if the monster is capable of casting spells of a higher level. On a failed d100 roll, the divine power only intervenes with a beneficial spell of 4th level or lower, with targets chosen by the monster as appropriate.

***Healing Prayer.*** As a bonus action, the monster can target one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target regains hit points equal to the monster's Wisdom modifier.

***Spirit Blast (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Each creature of the monster's choice within 30 feet of it must make a Consitution saving throw (DC is Wisdom-based), taking necrotic or radiant damage (monster's choice) equal to twice the monster's virtual cleric level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Power of Belief (3/Day).*** When the monster or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the monster can use its reaction to add or subtract its Wisdom modifier from the roll.

#### Druid
The druid class has two big components: spellcasting, and Wild Shape. Feel free to exclude either feature from your druid-like monsters as you see fit. Particularly strong druids can also receive traditional traits like Aggressive, Reckless, and Siege Monster while in beast form via Wild Shape.

***Nature's Wrath.*** The monster chooses one beast or plant it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the monster, the target uses its reaction to make one melee attack against a target that the monster can see.

***Power of Nature.*** Each beast and plant of the monster's choice within 30 feet of it has advantage or disadvantage (monster's choice) on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

***Speak with Beasts and Plants.*** The druid can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.

***Tree Stride.*** Once on its turn, the monster can use 10 feet of its movement to magically step into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or larger.

\columnbreak

&emsp;***Wild Shape (2/Day).*** The monster magically polymorphs into a beast or plant with a challenge rating as high as its virtual druid level divided by 3, and can remain in this form for a number of hours equal to half its virtual druid level. The monster can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The monster reverts to its true form if it dies or falls unconscious. The monster can revert to its true form using a bonus action on its turn.

While in a new form, the monster retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

The new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.

#### Fighter
Fighters are among the easiest classes to give to a monster; most of them can just be added without any modification. That said, there are some other features that you can use to represent a fighter that aren't given by the class itself.

***Martial Advantage.*** Once on each of its turns, the monster can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the monster that isn't incapacitated.

***Second Wind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, the monster can regain hit points equal to 10 + its virtual fighter level.

***Tactical Discipline.*** The monster has advantage on all ability checks and saving throws made during combat.

***Unyielding.*** When the monster is subjected to an effect that would move it, knock it prone, or both, it can choose to be neither moved nor knocked prone.

***Weapons Expert.*** A weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the monster hits with it.

#### Monk
The Ki-Empowered Technique and Martial Arts features below represent the core features of the monk class that could be used by a monster. Feel free to add or remove options from these features based on the monster's individual capabilities.

***Deft Strike (1/Turn).*** The monster can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack.

***Ki-Empowered Technique (Recharge 4-6).*** On each of its turns, the monster can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action, or to make one unarmed strike.

***Martial Arts (1/Turn).*** When the monster hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, the monster can choose one of the following additional effects (all DCs are Wisdom-based):

- The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop one item it is holding (monster's choice).
- The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the monster's next turn.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;***Mental Equilibrium.*** The monster has advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

***Stunning Strike (1/Turn).*** When the monster hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC is Wisdom-based). On a failed save, the creature is stunned until the end of the monster's turn.

#### Paladin
Rather than having to track spell slots and uses of Divine Smite, it is best to simply give a paladin monster the ability to passively deal radiant damage on its attacks. Otherwise, you are free to create abilities that represent an individual paladin's theme and divine power.

***Divine Fury.*** The monster's weapon attacks are magical. When the monster hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

***Healing Touch (3/Day).*** The monster touches another creature. The target magically regains hit points equal to the monster's virtual paladin level plus its Charisma modifier. In addition, the touch removes all diseases and neutralizes all poisons afflicting the target.

***Holy Vigor.*** Whenever the monster expends a spell slot, it also gains 1d8 temporary hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

***Resolute (2/Day).*** As a bonus action, the monster can magically end one spell or hostile effect on itself and each friendly creature within 30 feet of it.

***Unwavering.*** The monster has advantage on saving throws against effects that would charm, frighten, or incapacitate it, as well as those that would cause it to suffer exhaustion.

#### Ranger
The ranger occupies a strange niche, overlapping with both the druid and the rogue in some of its themes, enabling you to give your ranger monsters features like Evasion and Uncanny Dodge. Another issue is that they are meant to be exploration based, which is extremely useless for monsters in nearly all cases. Thus, I encourage you to focus on how a ranger monster's interactions with nature influence both its martial prowess and its magical abilities.

***Foe Slayer.*** The monster has advantage on attack rolls against one race of humanoid or one general creature type that isn't humanoid.

***Hunter's Mark (3/Day).*** As a bonus action, the monster can mark a creature it can see within 90 feet of it and make that creature its quarry. The target remains the monster's quarry for 1 hour, or until either the target or the monster drops to 0 hit points. While the target is marked, the monster has advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check it makes to find the target, and weapon attacks deal one extra die of damage when the monster hits the target with them.

***Lightfooted.*** The monster can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

***Natural Explorer.*** While the monster isn't incapacitated and is in a natural or untamed environment, it and any group it is with has advantage on checks made to avoid getting lost, to detect hidden threats while traveling, to track other creatures, or to find food or other natural resources.

***Tireless.*** The monster has advantage on saving throws against exhaustion, poison, and being knocked unconscious.

\columnbreak

#### Rogue
Many rogue features are straightforward and work well on monsters. Features like Pack Tactics can be used to enhance roguish monsters, while features like Nimble Escape and Shadow Stealth are simple variants of existing rogue features that you can use as appropriate. Just remember that hiding won't always be an option, so roguish monsters should have other tricks they can use in such unfavorable situations.

***Ambusher.*** In the first round of a combat, the monster has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it surprised.

***Cheap Shot (1/Turn).*** If the monster makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target can't take reactions and has its speed halved until the end of the monster's next turn.

***Exploit Weakness (1/Turn).*** If the monster makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage.

***Lurkers in Shadow.*** The monster is invisible to darkvision. While in dim light or darkness, the monster has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

***Surprise Attack.*** If the monster surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.

#### Sorcerer
Metamagics are best handled by making them at-will or giving them a recharge. Otherwise, emphasize that a sorcerer's innate abilities can be extremely powerful when channeled correctly.

***Arcane Vigor.*** The monster can expend a spell slot to reroll a saving throw it fails. The reroll also gains a +1 bonus for each slot level above 1st. It must use the new roll.

***Elemental Spell.*** When the monster casts a spell that deals damage, it can change the spell's damage to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

***Font of Magic.*** As a bonus action, the monster can roll a d4 and regain a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.

***Quick Cantrips.*** When the monster casts a spell using its action, it can cast one cantrip as a bonus action.

***Sorcerous Fortitude.*** The monster can maintain concentration on two different spells at the same time. In addition, it has advantage on saving throws to maintain concentration on spells.

#### Warlock
While warlocks certainly make good enemies due to their story potential, the nature of their spell slots makes it much harder to balance them sometimes. I would personally suggest simply ditching pact slots for your warlock enemies and making them only use Innate Spellcasting (or regular slots, if you think that would be better), especially as invocation spells are already treated as innate spells. Otherwise, it is fairly easy to give a monster an invocation of your choice, whether it is an existing invocation or a new invocation of your own design.

Beyond that, I recommend using cult features (such as the ones found in *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*) to make your warlock monsters unique when you can help it.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;***Beseech Patron (Recharge 5-6).*** As a bonus action, the monster can regain one spell slot.

***Dark Devotion.*** The monster has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

***Eldritch Ward.*** The monster has advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.

***Mind-Eroding Hex.*** As a bonus action, the monster can magically curse one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a Charisma saving throw (DC is Charisma-based). On a failed save, the target suffers disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws until the start of the monster's next turn.

***Potent Spellcasting.*** The monster can add its Charisma modifier to the damage it deals with any warlock cantrip.

#### Wizard
Wizards are probably the easiest spellcaster to represent because the base class has almost no features whatsoever, and not all mages need unique features to represent a specific arcane tradition (if they have one). That said, the features below can instead be used to represent various arcane traditions.

***Displacement (Recharge 5-6).*** As a bonus action, the monster projects an illusion that makes the monster appear to be standing in a place a few inches from its actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against the monster. The effect ends if the monster takes damage, it is incapacitated, or its speed becomes 0.

***Instinctive Charm (Recharge 5-6).*** The monster tries to magically divert an attack made against it, provided that the attacker is within 30 feet of it and visible to it. The monster must decide to do so before the attack hits or misses.

The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC is Intelligence-based). On a failed save, the attacker targets the creature closest to it, other than the monster or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.

***Limited Teleportation.*** When the monster expends a spell slot, it can also use its bonus action to teleport up to 10 feet per level of the slot expended. It must teleport to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Portent (Recharge 5-6).*** When the monster or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the monster can roll a d20 and choose to use this roll in place of the attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.

***Spell Ward (Recharge 4-6).*** When the monster takes damage from a spell, it can use its reaction to magically halve the damage taken.

### Abomination
An abomination is some sort of monster that has been corrupted, diseased, warped, or otherwise changed in some unnatural way. The source of this corruption determines its severity and specific nature.

***Frightening Screech (Action; Recharge 5-6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the monster that can hear it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC is Charisma-based) or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the monster's Frightening Screech for the next 24 hours.

***Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the monster must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC is Constitution-based) or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the monster's Stench for 24 hours.

\columnbreak

### Berserk Monster
A berserk monster is some sort of beast or other creature that has gone on an unstoppable rampage. Such creatures are often described to be feral or to have gone mad, and present a threat to anyone unfortunate enough to cross paths with them.

***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the monster can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the monster can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

***Unbreakable (3/Day).*** If the monster is incapacitated at the start of its turn, the effect causing this condition immediately ends on the monster.

### Bodyguard
A bodyguard is some sort of monster used by others used to protect them from physical harm. Some are trained warriors that use their skills for defense. Others use their brute force to attack a threat until they stop moving.

***Alert.*** The monster has advantage on initiative rolls, and it can't be surprised while it is conscious.

***Guard.*** As a reaction when an ally of the monster within 5 feet of it is hit by an attack, the monster causes itself to be hit instead.

***Hold the Line.*** As a reaction, the monster can make one melee weapon attack against a creature that enters its reach. If the attack hits, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

***Protective Retaliation.*** When a creature within 5 feet of the monster makes an attack against one of the monster's allies, the monster can use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.

### Boss Monster
The best way to turn a normal creature into a boss monster is to give it mythic traits and actions. You can use this template if you want an abbreviated process that you can elaborate on later. If you wish to make this monster a solo boss, choose a base creature with a CR that is equal to or slightly less than the average party level.

___
First, give the monster some legendary resistances and a mythic trait. If you'd like, you can replace Legendary Resistance with one of the alternative traits presented earlier in this document, and you can add extra effects that trigger alongside the mythic trait.

***Last Stand (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the monster is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains all of its hit points.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the monster fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

\pagebreakNum

Next, give the monster three legendary actions; you can adjust this number up or down if you have more or less than four characters in the party. Then, give the monster three of the legendary action options below.

___
- **Move.** The monster moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Detect.** The monster makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **At-Will Spell.** The monster casts one of its at-will spells.
- **Weak Attack.** The monster uses one of its weaker attacks.
- **Recharge (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster recharges one of its actions and uses it.

___
Finally, give the monster three of the mythic actions below.

___
- **Rush.** The monster moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Strong Attack.** The monster uses one of its strong attacks, or it uses one of its weaker attacks twice.
- **Assault (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster casts a spell.
- **Defend (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster gains advantage on all saving throws until the end of its next turn.


### Commander
A commander is a monster that is slightly smarter, wiser, or more charismatic compared to its kin or peers, granting it natural leadership skills that it can use in combat. For more guidelines for creating leader monsters, see my [Warlord Collection](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LtrZrYqZl6TBt8gu9lt) homebrew. 

***Ability Score Adjustment.*** The monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score increases by 2.

***Hit Dice.*** The monster gains two hit dice.

***Command Ally.*** As a bonus action, the monster targets one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. If the ally can see and hear the monster, it can make one weapon attack as a reaction and gains advantage on the attack roll.

***Leadership (Action; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the monster can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the monster. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the monster is incapacitated.

\columnbreak

### Dirty Fighter
Whether out of malice, fear, or a strong desire to succeed, a dirty fighter doesn't play by the rules. They will do whatever it takes to win, including taking the cheapest shots possible and ambushing foes in order to ensure the greatest chance of success.

___
The monster gains one of the following utility-based traits.

***Battle Adept.*** Opportunity attacks against the monster have disadvantage, and the monster's opportunity attacks against other creatures have advantage.

***Brawler.*** The monster can use its bonus action to attempt to grapple or shove a creature within its reach.

***Cheap Shot (1/Turn).*** If the monster makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target can't take reactions and has its speed halved until the end of the monster's next turn.

***Evade Foes.*** On each of its turns, the monster can use a bonus action to take the Disengage or Dodge action.

***Limited Reactiveness.*** The monster can take two reactions per round in combat.

___
The monster also gains one of the following offense-based traits.

***Cut Down.*** The monster has advantage on weapon attack rolls against any creature that has half of its hit points or fewer.

***Deadly Critical.*** The monster scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 and rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.

> ##### Mooks
> A mook is a group-oriented monster that is weaker than other monsters for the purpose of being cut down easily. Compared to a normal monster of its kind, a mook has one-fifth as many hit points, and is worth one-fifth as much XP. However, mooks take half damage from effects that target an area, such as the *fireball* spell.
> 
> To make combat fun as possible for melee characters, consider pairing this mook rule with the Cleaving Through Creatures optional rule. When using these two rules together, you can allow attacks to cleave through mooks that aren't necessarily in the original attack's reach. For example, perhaps the original attack causes the target's corpse to fly backwards, hitting and damaging more mooks in the process. Use discretion when ruling on this, and consider requiring an attacker to expend their movement in cases that wouldn't make sense otherwise.

> ##### TftYP Reprint: Reduced-Threat Monsters
> A reduced-threat monster uses a normal monster's statistics, but it has half the normal hit point maximum and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and saving throw DCs.
> 
> A reduced threat creature that is based on a creature bigger than Large is instead Large. Some specific reduced-threat creatures also make changes to the abilities they can use. A reduced-threat creature is worth half the normal XP earned for defeating it.

> ##### Where are the Monster Roles?
> After all this talk of monster roles, you may have expected the monsters in the appendices here to have them written down somewhere. There are three big reasons why they are absent:
>- I designed these monsters before I came up with these rules, which are an attempt to codify various practices scattered in my brain.
>- Official monsters don't have them, so perhaps it's best to stick to that format for compatibility reasons.
>- I'm lazy. Sue me.

\columnbreak

<br>

> It is up to you to discern which role or roles a monster can fill. For most monsters, both in this document and in the official books, it is obvious what role they fill. A barbarian leader is a brute and a leader, a hobgoblin is a soldier, a survivalist is a skirmisher, and so on.
>
> That said, when you make your own monsters, you can add a monster's role information on the same line as its Challenge Rating.
