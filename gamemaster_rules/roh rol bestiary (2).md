>___
>***Braindead.*** The afflicted cave goblin is immune to spells that require an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw.  
>
>***Explosive Death.*** When the afflicted cave goblin is reduced to 0 hit points, fungal spores explode, creating a 20-foot-radius cloud centered on its body. All creatures that start their turn in the fungal cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with goblin's trumpet (see Goblin's Trumpet).  
>
>***Goblin's Trumpet.*** It takes 1d4 days for the infected creature to start showing symptoms, which include shortness of breath and increased sensitivity to sunlight. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight when it or whatever it is trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of exhaustion by one. If this reduces the level of exhaustion to zero, the creature is cured. A failed save increases its level of exhaustion by one and the disease intensifies. After one failed save, the creature has a strong desire to surround itself with as many creatures as possible. After two failed saves, the creature becomes more irritable and violent. If the infected creature has 4 levels of exhaustion (hit points halved), spines of fungus erupt from its body, killing it, and the fungus takes full control of the creature's corpse. It gains the Explosive Death trait and Bite and Vomit Spores attacks from the afflicted cave goblin's stat block.  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The afflicted cave goblin makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

>
>***Vomit Spores (Recharge 5–6).*** The afflicted cave goblin exhales fungal spores in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with goblin's trumpet (see sidebar).

>***Gnoll's Kiss.*** This disease may have originated as an okiti weapon, but has since grown and mutated in the gutter gnolls' filthy habitat into a particularly nasty affliction. Tales of ghouls in the sewers often spring up around the horribly scarred, or even entirely skinless, corpses it leaves behind. Infected creatures begin showing symptoms after 1d4 days, including itchiness and sores. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and becomes vulnerable to poison and acid damage while infected.

If this reduces the level of exhaustion to zero, the creature is cured. A failed save increases its level of exhaustion by one as its sores begin to worsen and weep, dealing 1d10 poison damage for each level of exhaustion. If this damage reduces the creature's hit points to 0, its skin is entirely covered in open wounds and large areas begin to slough off, killing it through a combination of shock and dehydration.

>***Gnoll's Kiss.*** This disease may have originated as an okiti weapon, but has since grown and mutated in the gutter gnolls' filthy habitat into a particularly nasty affliction.

If it has 10 or fewer hit points, it can use its claw attack two additional times when it takes the multiattack action. These additional attacks are made with disadvantage.  
>
>***Frenzy.*** This disease affects the nervous systems of many creatures, altering their behavior over time to become more aggressive and unpredictable. Rock gnolls carry a particularly virulent strain. Infected creatures begin showing symptoms after 1d4 days, including headaches and increased thirst. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and requires twice the usual amount of water each day. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of exhaustion by one. If this reduces the level of exhaustion to zero, the creature is cured. A failed save increases its level of exhaustion by one and the disease intensifies. After one failed save, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever it is placed in a stressful situation or spend its turn making a melee attack against the nearest creature, moving up to its speed if necessary. The DC for this saving throw increases by 2 for each level of exhaustion above 1. If the infected creature has 4 levels of exhaustion (hit points halved), its mind is consumed by the disease and it reverts to an animalistic and wild state, attacking any who come near it. Until the disease can be cured, the creature's Intelligence is reduced by 10 (minimum 3).
