## Bandit Lord

Not just the leader of a simple gang, the bandit lord has gathered a small army of outlaws and brigands together through force of personality, wit, and strength of arms. To keep those followers in line, the bandit leader must rely on loyal captains whom the bandit lord rewards for their successes and brutally punishes for their failures.

Unlike those captains, who crave coin and maybe fame, the bandit lord is building an empire. So the bandit lord is always on the lookout for ways to expand at the expense of various rivals and plans contingencies for every occasion, realizing that nothing lasts forever. The bandit lord is ruthless when that's beneficial and magnanimous when it costs nothing

## Bearfolk

*Although it has the head of a shaggy bear, this humanoid creature wears armor and carries a battleaxe in one massive, clawed hand and a warhammer in the other. It's a solid slab of muscle that towers imposingly over most humans.*

The hulking bearfolk are intimidating creatures. Brutish and powerful, they combine features of humanoid beings and bears. Their heads are ursine with heavy jaws and sharp teeth. Dark fur covers their bodies, which are packed with muscle. Adult bearfolk stand at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 600 pounds.

***Sworn to the Bear King.*** Bearfolk are almost universally the subjects of the Bear King, one of the great fey lords. The bearfolk protect the cities of their northern kingdom and roam the wooded roads of the wilderness. The greatest number of bearfolk are concentrated around the court of the Bear King himself, with ancient bear jarls governing their unruly kin. Only a handful of renegades, exiles, and other rogue bearfolk live permanently outside this society.

***Passionate and Volatile.*** Boisterous and jovial, the bearfolk are a people of extremes. They celebrate with great passion and are quick to explosive anger. Settling differences with wrestling matches that leave permanent scars is common, as is seeing two bloodied bearfolk sharing a cask of mead and a raucous song after such a scuffle.

>***Fire Breath (Recharge 6).*** The behtu exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 21 (5d8) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.  
>
>***Ichorous Infusions.*** Behtu war parties carry 1d6 vials of ichorous infusions. They often ingest an infusion before an ambush. For the next 2d6 rounds, the behtus gain a +4 bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores and quadruple their base speed (including their climb speed). Behtus also take a âˆ’4 penalty to their Intelligence and Wisdom scores for the duration of the infusion. A non-behtu character who ingests a behtu infusion becomes poisoned and takes 10 (3d6) poison damage; a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw against poison reduces damage to half and negates the poisoned condition.

## Behtu

*With the face of a mandrill and the tusks of a great boar, these ferocious half-ape, half-human pygmies have demon blood flowing in their veins. Only the desperate or the suicidal travel to their volcanic temple-islands.*

Mechuiti (meh-CHOO-ee-tee), the demon lord of apes, cannibalism, and torture, combines the cruelty of a demon with the cunning of a human and the ferocity of an ape. He bred the same qualities into his people, the behtu (BAY-too), who carry his worship from island to island.

***Temple Builders.*** The behtus raise shrines to Mechuiti wherever they go. Some are kept and prosper, while others fall into decay and return to the jungle.

***Ichor Drinkers.*** In his volcanic temples, Mechuiti's idols weep his ichorous demon blood, which the behtus use to create infusions that give them inhuman strength and speed. The behtus also use the infusions to etch demonic tattoos that grant them infernal powers and protection.

***Scaly Mounts.*** The behtus breed demonic iguanas as war mounts (treat as giant lizards). The most powerful behtu sorcerers and druids have been known to ride large crimson drakes and small flame dragons as personal mounts.

>
>***Frightful Charge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The black knight commander lets loose a terrifying cry and makes one melee attack at the end of a charge. Whether the attack hits or misses, all enemies within 15 feet of the target and aware of the black knight commander's presence must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Black Knight Commander

The black knight commander strikes an imposing figure upon his chosen mount; one that inspires bloodlust in his allies and fear in his foes. Devoted to his own twisted code, the black knight commander has a sense of honor but he spares no compassion for those who stand in his way. Whether he fights for a dark lord or a demonic god, all of his foes will be trampled into the dust and their families slaughtered so there can be no revenge. The only victory is a total victory.

>***Breath of the North Wind (Recharge 5â€“6).*** Boreas' chosen exhales freezing breath in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) cold damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and its speed isn't reduced. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is petrified in ice until the end of its next turn instead.

## Boreas' Chosen

*The humanoid's piercing blue eyes lock on their target as it charges forward with bloodlust. Bloodcurdling battle cries and flying spears follow the berserker's charge.*Regardless of what type of prior life they led, any humanoid can become one of **Boreas'** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json)) chosen. Some humanoids are born with runic symbols designating them as creatures blessed by the North Wind, but most must undergo several trials before the first wintry rune scrawls itself into their flesh. The trials include surviving the highest mountain peaks in the dead of winter, defeating a **frost giant** in single combat, and crafting a spear out of the fang or claw of an icy beast. Even then, Boreas may deny his favor.

***Blood and Weapons of Ice.*** A humanoid chosen by Boreas goes through a transformation to become more like its patron. Its blood freezes into ice, and its weapons become forever rimed.

***Blessed and Loyal.*** Humanoids chosen by Boreas further his goals, protect his holy sites, spread winter wherever they walk, and honor the North Wind with every fallen foe.

## Burrowling

*These light brown, furred creatures inquisitively survey their surroundings, each comforted by the presence of the others.*

***Friendly Farmers.*** Burrowlings work together at every task: digging tunnels, foraging, and rearing their young. They are omnivorous, eating roots, berries, insects, and reptilesâ€”and they consider snakes a particular delicacy. The most advanced burrowling towns set up rudimentary farms, where they grow the fruits and vegetables they usually find in the wild.

***Safe Warrens.*** Some towns have domesticated prairie dogs, which burrowlings train to stand watch alongside their masters. Pairs of adults stand watch around the town perimeter and sound a warning when they spot a foe. An alerted town retreats to the safety of its warrens, while the strongest creatures add more tunnels if necessary, and close access from the surface until the threat has passed. In combat, burrowlings stand together in defense of the helpless young and fight with crude slings or their sharp teeth and claws.

***Die of Loneliness.*** If separated from its coterie, a burrowling becomes despondent, crying for others of its kind. A lone burrowling usually dies of loneliness within a week, unless it can find its way back to its town or discover another burrowling town. Rarely, a solitary creature makes its way to a non-burrowling settlement where it attempts to assist its new community. This frustrates the creature and those it interacts with as it tries to anticipate what its companions want. It may join an adventuring party in the hope of returning to a settlement. After spending at least six months with a party, the burrowling can use its Burrow Tactics ability with its new allies.

Burrowlings live up to 15 years. Twice a year, a burrowling female bears a litter of up to three pups, but in especially dangerous regions, the creatures breed prodigiously to keep their population ahead of massive attrition. In cases like this, a female has a litter of five pups every other month. A burrowling pup reaches adulthood in a year.

> ##### Burrowlings in Midgard
>Burrowling towns are found in the Western Wastes, where their greatest enemies are dust goblins. They seem to thrive in the badlands and magically scant territories of former human settlements.

>
>***Orders to Attack (1/Day).*** Each creature of the city watch captain's choice that is within 30 feet of it and can hear it makes one melee or ranged weapon attack as a reaction.

## City Watch Captain

This person could easily have been on the other side of the law, but he likes the way he looks in the city watch uniformâ€”and the way city residents look at him when he walks down the street leading a patrol. With a long mustache and a jaunty cap, there's no denying that he cuts a rakishly handsome figure. While a trained investigator, the city watch captain is not afraid to draw his blade to end a threat to his city.

## Deep One

*With enormous eyes, a wide mouth, and almost no chin, the deep ones are hideous, fishlike folk, often hunched and scaled when encountered in coastal villages.*

***Elder Gods.*** In their fully grown form, the deep ones are an ocean-dwelling race that worships elder gods such as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, and they dwell in deep water darkness. They've intermarried with coastal humans to create human-deep one hybrids.

***Coastal Raiders.*** The deep ones keep to themselves in isolated coastal villages and settlements in the ocean for long periods, and then turn suddenly, at the command of their patron gods, into strong, relentless raiders, seizing territory, slaves, and wealth all along the coasts. Some deep ones have even founded small kingdoms lasting generations in backwater reaches or distant chilled seas.

***Demand Sacrifices.*** They demand tolls from mariners frequently; those who do not leave tribute to them at certain islands or along certain straits find the fish escape their nets, or the storms shatter their hulls and drown their sailors. Over time, some seafaring nations have found it more profitable to ally themselves with the deep ones; this is the first step in their patient plans to dominate and rule.

> ##### Gods of the Deep Ones
>The deep ones are faithful servants of horrific powers inimical to all life on land. Father Dagon is a god of fertility, fish, and the strength of the deep ocean, and is an evil lord of storm and waves. Mother Hydra is his consort, a goddess of immense strength and size, spawning entire schools of fish at once and mistress of the great kraken and toothsome krake spawn, who are her children and servitors. Both are keen on conquest, through a long program of forced interbreeding and eldritch meddling with human bloodlines.
>
>In addition, many deep ones follow Shar-Ngolyeth, a long-lost deity also referred to as That Which Lurks Beneath the Waves. This kraken and her krake spawn offspring are close allies to the deep ones, but are largely indifferent to Dagon and Hydra.

## Deep One Hybrid Priest

*With enormous eyes, a wide mouth, and almost no chin, the deep ones are hideous, fishlike folk, often hunched and scaled when encountered in coastal villages.*

***Elder Gods.*** In their fully grown form, the deep ones are an ocean-dwelling race that worships elder gods such as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, and they dwell in deep water darkness. They've intermarried with coastal humans to create human-deep one hybrids.

***Coastal Raiders.*** The deep ones keep to themselves in isolated coastal villages and settlements in the ocean for long periods, and then turn suddenly, at the command of their patron gods, into strong, relentless raiders, seizing territory, slaves, and wealth all along the coasts. Some deep ones have even founded small kingdoms lasting generations in backwater reaches or distant chilled seas.

***Demand Sacrifices.*** They demand tolls from mariners frequently; those who do not leave tribute to them at certain islands or along certain straits find the fish escape their nets, or the storms shatter their hulls and drown their sailors. Over time, some seafaring nations have found it more profitable to ally themselves with the deep ones; this is the first step in their patient plans to dominate and rule.

> ##### Gods of the Deep Ones
>The deep ones are faithful servants of horrific powers inimical to all life on land. Father Dagon is a god of fertility, fish, and the strength of the deep ocean, and is an evil lord of storm and waves. Mother Hydra is his consort, a goddess of immense strength and size, spawning entire schools of fish at once and mistress of the great kraken and toothsome krake spawn, who are her children and servitors. Both are keen on conquest, through a long program of forced interbreeding and eldritch meddling with human bloodlines.
>
>In addition, many deep ones follow Shar-Ngolyeth, a long-lost deity also referred to as That Which Lurks Beneath the Waves. This kraken and her krake spawn offspring are close allies to the deep ones, but are largely indifferent to Dagon and Hydra.

## Derro Explorer

*The small humanoid sets its claw-toothed boots into the rock, steadying itself, then looses an arrow. Its lips curl into a cruel smile as a cry of surprise and shouts of alarm resound in the dark cavern.*Deep beneath the earth, the derro gather in clans and worship beings that dwell between the stars.

>___
>***Enchanted Cage.*** The iron cage that holds the fetal savant provides cover for the creature. The cage (AC 19, 10 hp) is considered an equipped object when borne by a derro and cannot be attacked directly. In addition, the cage protects the occupant from up to 20 spell levels of spells 4th level or lower but provides no protection to those outside of the cage. Spells of level 5 or higher take full, normal effect against the cage and its occupant. Once the cage protects against 20 or more spell levels it is rendered non-magical. If exposed to direct sunlight for over one hour of cumulative time it is destroyed.  
>
>***Madness.*** A derro fetal savant's particular madness grants it immunity to psychic effects. It cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a *wish* spell or comparable magic. A derro fetal savant brought to sanity gains 4 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.  
>
>***Vulnerability to Sunlight.*** A derro fetal savant takes 1 point of Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight, and it dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution points are recovered at the rate of 1/Day spent underground or otherwise sheltered from the sun.  
>
>### Actions
>***Babble.*** The sight of potential host bodies so excites the fetal savant that it babbles and giggles madly and childishly, creating an insanity effect. All sane creatures that start their turns within 60 feet of the fetal savant must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be affected by *confusion* (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. This is a psychic effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same fetal savant's babbling for 24 hours. This action cannot be taken when the fetal savant is using Soul Exchange.  
>
>***Soul Exchange.*** As an action, the fetal savant can attempt to take control of a creature it can see within 90 feet, forcing an exchange of souls as a magic jar spell, using its own body as the container. The fetal savant can use this power at will, but it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time. The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant's soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target's body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light.  
>As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim's soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in the fetal savant's withered body, the victim is effectively paralyzed and helpless.

## Derro Fetal Savant

*This creature resembles a blue-skinned dwarven infant, no older than a year. Its limbs flail and its head lolls with an obvious lack of coordination, and it screams incessantly.*

Of the madness and insanity that resonates so strongly in derro society, perhaps none is so twisted as these premature infants, born insane and destined to lead their people further into madness. These derro are known as fetal savants.

***Soul Swapping.*** Only the rarest of derro are born with the ability to exchange souls with other creatures, and when discovered, the babbling infants are treated with maddened reverence.

***Carried into Battle.*** Placed in small, intricately wrought pillowed cages and borne aloft on hooked golden staves, the wild-eyed newborns are used to sow madness and confusion among enemy ranks.

***Fear the Sun.*** Fetal savants hate and fear all bright lights.

>***Infectious Insanity (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The derro chooses a creature it can see within 30 feet and magically assaults its mind. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by a *confusion* spell for 1 minute. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Derro Shadow Antipaladin

*This blue-skinned creature resembles a stunted dwarf. Its eyes are large and its hair wild, and both are colorless. The expression on its face is a terrible rictus of madness and hate.*

All derro are mad, but some devote their very souls to the service of insanity. They embrace the powers of darkness and channel shadow through their minds to break the sanity of any creatures they encounter. Derro shadow antipaladins are the elite servants of gods like Nyarlathotep and the Black Goat of the Woods.

***Herald of Madness.*** The derro shadow antipaladin is insanity personified. Despite being called paladins, these unhinged creatures aren't swaggering warriors encased in steel or their dark reflections. Instead, a shadow antipaladin serves as a more subtle vector for the madness of its patron. They are masters of shadow magic and stealth who attack the faith of those who believe that goodness can survive the approaching, dark apotheosis. Death, madness, and darkness spread in the shadow antipaladin's wake.

Each non-derro creature within 5 feet of the shadowseeker that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by a *confusion* spell for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the shadowseeker's Maddening Convulsions for the next 24 hours.

## Derro Shadowseeker

*This blue-skinned creature wears leather armor smeared with blood and filth, though the dagger it wields is immaculate. Its milky eyes complement equally white hair, which sprouts chaotically from its head. Its movements are twitchy and unpredictable.****Erratic Combatants.*** Derro shadowseekers manifest their insanity in their physicality. They seem to have a continual series of muscle spasms that control their movements. Their apparent randomness is distracting to their foes, which enables them to better land killing blows. The bafflement they cause in combat also allows them to move about the battlefield without heed for their safety, as practiced blows fail to land on them.

***Unreliable Allies.*** Shadowseekers are aware they are more effective when allying with other creatures, but they detest working with others. If a situation forces shadowseekers to work with allies, they often mock their ostensible partners and work to maneuver their allies into unfavorable positions. A squabbling group of shadowseekers invokes a bewildering array of threats and ridicule that often throws off their foes.

## Dust Goblin

*A ragged creature emerges from the sand. Its spindly frame is encased in a hodge.podge of armor scraps and rusted weapons. A long, hooked nose protrudes over a wide mouth filled with sharp teeth.*

Dust goblins vary greatly in size and appearance, although they are universally scrawny, bony, and lanky. They seem to suffer from malnutrition even when in perfect health, a perception reinforced by the way their bellies distend after they've gorged themselves on flesh. Their skin is always dry and cracked, ranging from dusky gray to dark green in color.

***Rule the Wastelands.*** Dust goblins are twisted creatures, tainted by many generations of life in a blasted wasteland. After a magical war devastated the dust goblins' homeland, they rose to become the most dominant inhabitants. They inhabit ancient ruins and ambush travelers who stray too close to their borders.

***Twisted Minds.*** The lingering magical energy saturating the wastes of their home, coupled with the harsh conditions in which they scratch out a living, have tainted the minds of all dust goblins. Their thinking is alien and unfathomable to most creatures. Whereas most goblins are cowardly, dust goblins don't seem to experience fear. To the contrary, they enjoy wearing skull helmets and using ghostly whistles to frighten foes.

Owing to this alien mindset, dust goblins get along disturbingly well with aberrations. The creatures often forge alliances and work together for mutual benefit, while making their unnerving mark on communal lairs.

Dust goblins range from 2 to 4 feet tall, and weigh between 20 and 80 pounds.

The dwarven ringmage does not regain the spell slot until the ring is discharged or the dwarven ringmage chooses to dismiss the spell.

## Dwarven Ringmage

The dwarven ringmage is a master of the imbuing magic of the reaver dwarves. With his aid, his reaver allies are more than just dangerous warriors; they can augment their abilities with powerful spells or surprise their enemies with unexpected powers. Often well armored and always bearing a host of spells, the dwarven ringmage can dominate any battlefield.

## Edjet Initiate

*Glaring about in brazen challenge to any that would meet its eyes, this elite dragonborn warrior searches for its next target. Adorned in padded armor, its clawed hand never ventures far from the hilt of its sword.****True Believers.*** Edjet initiates display all of the fanaticism of the elite **edjet** ([Creature Codex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/collection/Kobold Press; Creature Codex.json)), but they have yet to develop their precision and poise on the battlefield. Rarely will edjet initiates be turned aside by fear of deathâ€”failure is a much more fearsome prospect.

***Ready to Impress.*** Before edjet initiates can join the ranks of the edjet corps, they must first prove themselves in battle. This desire often leads them to take great risks on the battlefield, but edjet officers view this process as the natural means to separate those with the will and skill to become true edjet from those that merely aspire to such. Those initiates that are not killed in the course of their training, but that otherwise fail to meet edjet standards, often settle into a lesser role in the military machine as scouts, archers, or other auxiliaries.

## Einherjar

*Stout bearded warriors with golden auras, the einherjar wear chain mail and carry two-handed battle axes and oaken shieldsâ€”their badges and symbols are all different, and it is said no two braid their beards quite alike.*

As the spirits of warriors chosen by the valkyries and brought to Valhalla to fight for the gods against the giants, the einherjar are great warriors who eat and drink their fill of boar and mead each night, then spend their days preparing for Ragnarok. Some of this is combat training, and other portions are raids against the Jotun giants and thursir giants, to try their strength. Regardless of how often they are slain, the einherjar reappear each morning in Odin's hall, so they have no fear of death, and their courage shames others into greater bravery.

***Defenders of the Mortal World.*** From time to time, the ravenfolk guide a troop of the einherjar against some of Loki's minions or the servants of Boreas. These raids are often small battles, but the einherjar know they are only delaying the inevitable rise of the world serpent and its many evil spawn. This drives them to greater efforts against giants, demons, lindwurms, and other evil creatures, but the einherjar themselves are not exactly saintly. They drink, they carouse, they slap and tickle and brag and boast and fart with the loudest and most boastful of Asgardians. Unlike most extraplanar creatures, they are very human, if somewhat larger than life.

***Fear Dragons.*** The einherjar have a notable soft spot for the ratatosk and the ravenfolk, but they are superstitiously fearful of dragons of all kinds. They sometimes hunt or ride or carouse with the fey lords and ladies, especially the Bear King, the Snow Queen, and the Lord of the Hunt.

***Never Speak to the Living.*** In theory, the einherjar are forbidden from speaking with the living: they must pass their words through a valkyrie, a ratatosk, one of the ravenfolk, or other races allied with Asgard. In practice, this rule is often flouted, though if Loki's servants notice it, they can dismiss any einherjar back to Valhalla for a day.

>___
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The eonic drifter can either use Drift Backward or make two attacks with its time warping staff. The eonic drifter's future self (if present) can only use Drift Forward.  
>
>***Time Warping Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage.  
>
>***Drift Backward (1/Day).*** A future self of the eonic drifter materializes in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the drifter. The future self has the eonic drifter's stats and its full hit points, and it takes its turn immediately after its present self. Killing the original eonic drifter makes its future self disappear. If the present self sees its future self die, the eonic drifter must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. There is no effect if the save succeeds. If the saving throw fails, roll 1d6 to determine the effect on the eonic drifter: 1 = frightened, 2 = incapacitated, 3 = paralyzed, 4 = unconscious, 5 or 6 = has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. These effects last 1d4 rounds.  
>
>***Drift Forward (2/Day).*** The future self makes a time warping staff attack against a target. If the attack hits, instead of causing bludgeoning damage, both the target and the attacker jump forward through time, effectively ceasing to exist in the present time. They reappear in the same locations 1d4 rounds later, at the end of the present self's turn. Creatures occupying those locations at that moment are pushed 5 feet in a direction of their own choosing. The target of the drift (but not the future self) must then make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, with effects identical to those for the eonic drifter witnessing the death of its future self (see Drift Backward). The future self doesn't reappear after using this ability the second time; only the target of the drift reappears from the second use. This does not trigger a saving throw for the present self.

## Eonic Drifter

*The air crackles and lights flicker in the ruins. In a whirl of colorful robes, the drifter materializes from the unfathomable maelstroms of time. His eyes scan the hall in panic, anticipating the terrible revelations of yet another era.*

***Adrift in Time.*** Not much is known about the time traveling eonic drifters other than that they left a dying civilization to look for help not available in their own age. To their misfortune, returning to their own time proved much more difficult than leaving it, so the eonic drifters found themselves adrift in the river of time. As the decades passed, their chance of returning home withered, along with the flesh of their bodies. They have been become mummified by the passing ages.

***Crystal Belts.*** A drifter carries an odd assembly of gear gathered in countless centuries, proof of its tragic journey. The more eclectic the collection, the more jumps it has performed on its odyssey.

Belts of crystals around its body store the energy that fuels a drifter's travels. After each large jump through time, the reservoirs are exhausted and can be used only for very short jumps.

***Jittery and Paranoid.*** Visiting countless eras in which mankind has all but forgotten this once-great civilization has robbed most eonic drifters of their sanity. Their greatest fear is being robbed of their crystal belts. They plead or fight for them as if their lives depended on themâ€”which, in a sense, they do.

Adventurers who convince a drifter of their good intentions may be asked for aid. In exchange, a drifter can offer long-lost artifacts gathered from many forays through time.

Drifters can appear at any time or place, but they often frequent the sites of their people's past (or future) cities. There they are comforted by knowing that they're at least in the right place, if not the right time.

>- The savant can concentrate on two spells simultaneously. If it casts a third spell that requires concentration, the savant loses concentration on the oldest spell. If the savant is concentrating on two spells and loses concentration because of taking damage, it loses concentration on the oldest spell.
>- When a creature targets the savant with an attack, roll a d6. On a 1 through 4, the attack hits one of the savant's future or past selves, halving the damage the savant takes. On a 5 or 6, the attack hits the savant, and it takes damage as normal. The savant is still the target of the attack and is subject to effects that trigger when a creature is hit or damaged.

## Eonic Savant

*A jagged blue scar of magical energy forms in the air, and a blue-robed figure steps out a moment later. As it moves, echoes of it appear to move a split second before and after it. The creature focuses its attention and the echoes solidify around it, one wielding the creature's staff, the other a spell.*The eonic savant is an **eonic drifter** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json)) who learned to fully harness the power of its many future and past selves.

***Still Adrift in Time.*** Through their mastery of time, they were able to spare their bodies many of the same ravages of time experienced by their brethren. In spite of this mastery, they are no closer to finding the cure or the correct time stream for their dying ancient civilization.

***Calm and Assured.*** Unlike their kin, eonic savants hold the energy to jump through time within their bodies, freeing them from a reliance on their people's crystal belts and the paranoia its loss brings. Savants devote themselves to studying the rivers of time and helping their kin, who are barely surviving time's flood. They are certain with enough study and enough of their kin by their sides, they can discover the way to a cure and the way home.

## Erina Defender

*This small humanoid has a slightly pointed face with bright, brown eyes and a black, snout-like nose. Its skin is covered in short, tan fur, and its head, shoulders, and back have smoothed-down quills.*

Erinas, or hedgehog folk, are a small, communal race.

As the largest and hardiest of their kind, erina defenders take the defense of their home tunnels very seriously, and are quite suspicious of outsiders. Once an outsider proves himself a friend, they warm considerably, but until then defenders are quite spiky.

***Burrowed Villages.*** Natural diggers at heart, erinas live in shallow networks of tunnels and chambers they excavate themselves. Enemies who attack the peaceful erinas easily become confused and lost in the mazelike tunnels. On their own ground, the erinas can easily evade, outmaneuver, or surround invaders. They often lure them onto choke points where the enemy can be delayed endlessly while noncombatants and valuables are hustled to safety through other tunnels.

***Scroungers and Gatherers.*** Erinas are naturally curious. They tend to explore an area by tunneling beneath it and popping up at interesting points. They dislike farming, but subsist mainly on the bounty of the land surrounding their homes. In cities, they still subsist on what they can find, and they have a knack for finding whatever they need. Sometimes they are called thieves, but they aren't greedy or malicious. They take only what they need, and seldom take anything from the poor. Some humans even consider it lucky to have a family of erinas nearby.

## Folk of Leng

*The people of Leng are hideous and malevolent, with small horns and goatlike legs they keep concealed beneath turbans, and mouths full of rows of serrated teeth, somewhat akin to sharks. They have a fondness for combining heavy leathers and bright silks in their robes, and they always go forth masked when leaving their chilled cities.*

***Dimensional Merchants.*** The folk of Leng are interplanar merchants and avid slavers, trading silks, rubies, and the manaencrusted stones of Leng for humanoid slaves. They sail between worlds in peculiar ships with split, lateen-rigged masts and rigging that howls like the damned in high winds. They tend a few pyramids in the deep deserts and are said to befriend void dragons, heralds of darkness, and other servants of the void.

***A High Plateau.*** Leng is a forbidding plateau surrounded by hills and peaks. Its greatest city is Sarkomand, a place which some claim has fallen into ruin, and which others claim to have visited in living memory.

***Love of Nets.*** When in combat, the folk of Leng use nets woven from the silk of their racial enemies, the spiders of Leng. They summon these nets from interdimensional storage spaces.

## Gearforged Templar

*The bronze and mithral figure advances with heavy movements. Its eye lenses glare dark blue, and gears click when it swings its glaive.*

An intricate construction of bronze, steel, copper, and mithral, the gearforged templar is an imposing sight. A humanoid spirit contained in a soulgem animates the heavy body of gears and springs. Gearforged are relatively rare, and the champion is a paragon among them.

***Tireless Defender.*** The gearforged templar is relentless in pursuit of its duty. More so then  other gearforged, the champion's mindset becomes fixed on its charge to the exclusion of distractions and even magical coercion. Gearforged templars serve as commanders of military or guard units, bodyguards for important individuals, or personal champions for nobility.

***Constructed Nature.*** The gearforged templar doesn't require food, drink, air, or sleep.

## Gnoll Havoc Runner

*The runner is a mottled blur, a sprinting gnoll laughing as it runs, ax held high. It sprints past, its weapon flashing in the sun.*

With the bristly mane and spotted fur characteristic of all gnolls, havoc runners blend into their tribe. Only the canny glint in the eyes hints at the deadly difference before the havoc runner explodes into violence.

***Blinding Raids.*** Havoc runners are scouring storms across the trade routes that crisscross the tribe's territory. Like all gnolls, they are deadly in battle. Havoc runners incorporate another quality that makes them the envy of many raiders: they can tell at a glance which pieces of loot from a laden camel or wagon are the most valuable, without spending time rummaging, weighing, or evaluating. Their ability to strike into a caravan, seize the best items, and withdraw quickly is unparalleled.

## Gray Orc

*The ground erupts into a scrambling flood of orcs, their pale skin decorated with swirls of black resin.*Dwelling deep beneath the ground, gray orcs move in a dark world, only drawn toward the surface by their innate hatred of arcane defilement.

***Drawn to Magical Corruption.*** Gray orcs are drawn to areas where magic is frequently used or locations marred by magical pollution. Scholars believe the orcs' ancestral home was ravaged by magic, cursing them and driving them deep beneath the surface. They believe this history fuels within the orcs a deep hatred for magic, especially magic that defiles the natural world. For their part, the orcs have neither confirmed nor denied this speculation, though few scholars have been brave enough to approach them about it. Whatever the case, gray orcs grow violent around magic and seek to snuff it out wherever they find it.

***Synchronized Tribes.*** Gray orcs move and act as one, their training leading their actions to be so synchronized that they appear to think as one. When faced with a major threat or a large magical catastrophe, a group of gray orcs will erupt from the ground in unison to swarm over the source.

***Silent Hunters.*** Adept at surviving in a dark and quiet world below the ground, gray orcs instinctively know how to move, hunt, and kill without making the slightest sound. When they hunt, gray orcs paint their pale skin with swirls of a mushroom-based black resin. They often form the resin into runes or symbols of their gods as a way of honoring the gods and asking for success on the hunt.

## Harefolk

*What appears to be an arctic hare given humanoid form is clad in leather armor and stands with its shortsword at the ready. Its bright eyes take everything in, while its nose quivers in search of predators.****Werewolf Foes.*** Harefolk have a long-standing hatred for **werewolves**, owing to their near extinction at the lycanthropes' jaws. All present-day harefolk know the story of Mathilda Lopear who, along with an adventuring band of humans (often downplayed or removed from stories about Mathilda), fought and killed a werewolf tribe and saved the lives of the last remaining harefolk clans. Because of this ancient enmity toward werewolves, harefolk are wary of other lycanthropes and shapechangers, even primarily good-aligned creatures such as **werebears**.

***Rabbit Tenders.*** Harefolk keep **arctic hares** and other rabbits capable of surviving in arctic climes as pets. They believe the presence of rabbits brings good luck to a clan. Nomadic clans of harefolk ensure their pets can forage grasses as they travel, while more domestic clans grow gardens of hardy vegetables to feed the rabbits. Since harefolk are omnivorous, supplementing their diet of grubs and other insects with vegetation they find or grow, their dietary needs keep them from competing with their pets for resources. Though they are capable of eating flesh from other creatures, their bond with rabbits keeps many harefolk from hunting game animals, including non-rabbits. Adventuring harefolk often bring along a rabbit as a companion animal or familiar.

***Pranksters.*** Harefolk enjoy pulling harmless tricks on each other, and stories of memorable pranks are passed down through generations. When dealing with their enemies, harefolk pranks turn injurious if not lethal. One of their favorite tricks is to seed areas beneath the snow with *snares* and bear traps. As they lead pursuers through these areas, they bound safely over the snow while the creatures pursuing them sink below the surface and set off the traps.

## Initiate of the Elder Elementals

*The kobold stands at the stone altar, chanting words of elemental power. Winds swirl around it, the stone beneath its feet rumbles, and fire ignites in one hand while frost rimes the other.****Elemental Servant.*** Serving as part of a secret cabal, the initiate taps into the elemental magic that taints it to serve the four great elemental lords of evil. It often worships in secret underground sites devoted to its dark gods. Service means access to power, and an initiate hopes to use that power to rise in station.

>
>***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

## Knight Ab-errant

*A man of supernatural physique swings his mighty hammer with the ease and abandon of a child wielding a fallen tree branch. Beneath his ruined tabard, swirling runes and sigils dance across an impossibly muscular frame.*Once ordinary warriors, these towering behemoths have been scourged by wild and unpredictable magic that lingers in forgotten and forbidden parts of the world.

***Revised Beyond Recognition.*** Perhaps a paladin claims a trophy from an ancient and unknowable force from beyond the stars, after routing a dungeon of its followers and slowly, the trophy changes him. In the heat of combat, a simple swordsman might quaff the wrong potion and be spontaneously transformed by an errant wizard's experimental brew. Whatever their origins, they now walk the world as hulking abominations, gifted strength unimaginable in an ironic reflection of their former selves.

***Born of Boons.*** Although many knights ab-errant may be altered after exposure to unpredictable arcane sorcery, some were created by divine magic. These may be devotees of trickster gods, or ones that are especially cruel, or they may have prayed to innocuous deities in ways that were unorthodox or otherwise wanting.

> ##### Knights Ab-errant in Midgard
>A growing number of knights ab-errant have been seen aimlessly wandering the Western Wastes of Midgard, wearing the livery of the White Knights of Bourgund. Whether these individuals were transformed after exposure to the fell energies of nearby fallen magocracies, after traversing too close to the shadows of the Dread Walkers, or via the machinations of separatist mages of Bemmea who long to be free of their bonds of servitude to the knights, Bourgund seeks to eradicate these deviants that are so evidently tied to their proud realm.

Instead of poison damage, the kobold can grant resistance to the damage type currently in effect for its Apothecary trait.  
>
>***Explosive Flask (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The kobold throws a flask of volatile substances at a point within 30 feet. The flask explodes in a 15-foot radius. Creatures in the area take 17 (5d6) poison damage and are poisoned for 1 minute, or take half damage and are not poisoned with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success. Instead of poison damage, the kobold can deal the damage type currently in effect for its Apothecary trait.

## Kobold Alchemist

*This slight, reptilian humanoid is bedecked with ceramic flasks and glass vials. An acrid reek follows in the creature's wake.*

Kobold alchemists are usually smelled before they are seen, thanks to the apothecary's store of chemicals and poisons they carry. Alchemists often sport mottled and discolored scales and skin, caused by the caustic nature of their obsessions. They raid alchemy shops and magical laboratories to gather more material to fuel their reckless experiments.

***Dangerous Assets.*** Alchemists can be a great boon to their clan, but at a cost. Not only do the alchemists require rare, expensive, and often dangerous substances to ply their trade, they tend to be a little unhinged. Their experiments yield powerful weapons and defensive concoctions that can save many kobold lives, but the destruction caused by an experiment gone awry can be terrible.

## Kobold Chieftain

*This small, draconic humanoid struts as though it were ten feet tall. It wears the gilded skull of a small dragon as a helmet, and its beady eyes gleam out through the skull's sockets. It hefts its spear and shield and lets out a blood-curdling shriek, signaling the attack.*

While most kobolds are scuttling scavengers or pathetic sycophants, a few carry a spark of draconic nobility that can't be ignored. These few forge their tribes into forces to be reckoned with, rising to the rank of chieftain. A kobold chieftain stands proud, clad in war gear of fine quality and good repair. Their weapons are tended by the tribe's trapsmiths, particularly evident in their springspike shields.

***Living Legend.*** A kobold chieftain is more than a leader, it is a symbol of the tribe's greatness. The strongest, most cunning, most ruthless of a kobold tribe embodies their connection to the revered dragons. When a chieftain sounds the call to battle, the kobolds meld into a fearless, deadly force.

*The reptilian snout peeking out from a deep hood is the only hint that this cloaked figure is a kobold. A fang charm dangling from its neck, the kobold goes about its business of secrets and whispers.****Agents of the Empire.*** Kobold spellclerks work primarily as messengers and agents of the Dragon Empire's spy network. They are skilled in code writing and breaking, overseeing the operations of other field agents, and providing their overlords a valued glimpse into the internal affairs of their enemies.

***Trusted Messengers.*** Kobold spellclerks are often granted the use of magic items that aid in encryption and message-sending to supplement their natural skills and magical studies. The messages they carry or compose are often of great import to clandestine activities.

> ##### Kobold Spellclerks in Midgard
>The spellclerks operate as the lowest rank of spy in the Mharoti Empire's spy network, which is jointly administered by Parsis the Hidden and Kah Vizier Zeki Hasan Al Eski. In spite of their lower status, they are no less important to the spy network and make up the majority of Mharoti's spies abroad. At home, spellclerks are treated with a mixture of respect and wariness, as the spies are used just as often within the empire to root out those who chafe under dragon rule.
>
>Kobold spellclerks in Midgard typically prepare *dragon roar* in place of *fire bolt* and *converse with dragon* in place of *feather fall*. Both spells can be found in *Deep Magic for 5th Edition*.

>- **Proficiency Bonus** +2
>___
>***Pack Tactics.*** The kobold trapsmith has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the trapsmith's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.  
>
>***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the kobold trapsmith has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  
>
>***Thief's Tools.*** The kobold trapsmith has proficiency with *thief's tools* and is seldom without them. If its tools are taken away or lost, it can cobble together a new set from wire, bits of metal, and other junk in 30 minutes.  
>
>***Traps and Snares.*** The kobold trapsmith excels at setting mechanical traps. Detecting, disarming, avoiding, or mitigating its traps require successful DC 13 checks or saving throws, and the traps have +5 attack bonuses. With *thief's tools* and basic construction materials, a trapsmith can set up one of the simple but effective traps listed below in 5 minutes. Triggers involve pressure plates, tripwires, small catches in a lock, or other simple mechanisms.  
>- **Choke Bomb.** This small incendiary device burns rapidly and releases choking smoke in a 20-foot sphere. The area is heavily obscured. Any breathing creature that's in the affected area when the cloud is created or that starts its turn in the cloud is poisoned. Once a poisoned creature leaves the cloud, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success. The smoke dissipates after 10 minutes, or after 1 round in a strong wind.
>- **Poisoned Sliver.** A poisoned sliver or needle can be hidden almost anywhere: inside a lock or a box, in a carpeted floor, on the underside of a door handle, in a cup of liquid or a bowl of gems. When someone meets the conditions for being jabbed by the sliver, the trap makes a melee weapon attack with advantage: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target; *Hit:* 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
>- **Skullpopper.** This trap consists of either a heavy weight, a spike, or a blade, set to fall or swing into a victim. When triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack against the first target in its path: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target; *Hit:* 11 (2d10) damage. The type of damage depends on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a scything blade does slashing damage, etc.
>- **Slingsnare.** A concealed loop of rope or wire is affixed to a counterweight. When a creature steps into the snare, it must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be yanked into the air and suspended, upside down, 5 feet above the ground. The snared creature is restrained (escape DC 13). The cord is AC 10 and has 5 hit points.
>
>
>### Actions
>***Dagger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.  
>
>***Light Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.  
>
>***Shredder (Recharge 6).*** The kobold trapsmith primes and throws a device at a point within 30 feet. The device explodes when it hits something solid, flinging razor-sharp spikes in a 15-foot-radius sphere. Every creature in the area takes 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The ground inside the spherical area is littered with spikes; it becomes difficult terrain, and a creature that falls prone in the area takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage.  
>
>***Stunner (1/Day).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is restrained (escape DC 13). While restrained, the target takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage at the start of its turn and falls prone. The trapsmith has advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor. A stunner is a bola made of metal wire, magnets, and static electricity capacitors. A kobold trapsmith can recharge it during a long rest.

## Kobold Trapsmith

*This kobold is bedecked in satchels, pouches, sacks, and bandoliers. All of these are bursting with tools, bits of scrap, wire, cogs and twine. Impossibly large eyes blink through the lenses of its goggles.*

Some kobolds hatch a bit cleverer than their counterparts. These sharp-witted creatures feel driven to fiddle with the world, and those that don't meet an early demise through accident or violence often take up tinkering. Trapsmiths make a kobold lair into a deadly gauntlet of hidden pain.

> ##### Shifting Peril
>Trapsmiths aren't warriors; they avoid direct confrontation with enemies that aren't mired in traps or engaged with other foes. If the trapsmith senses that invaders in its lair are likely to get past its traps, it tries to hide or escape.
>
>A trapsmith delights in laying traps and snares behind invaders, along tunnels and paths they've already cleared and believe to be safe, then luring them back through its handiwork.
>

> ##### Trapsmith Needs Traps!
>The trapsmith falls between CR Â½ and 1, depending on how many traps PCs fall into before they corner him. For 1 or 2 traps, assume CR Â½. For 4 or more, use CR 1. Make sure to put the trapsmith to work!

Another creature can use an action to shake the target awake and end its unconsciousness but not the poisoning.

## Lemurfolk

*This furred humanoid glides silently through the canopy of trees, gripping a blowgun. It observes visitors cautiously with two intelligent, bulbous eyes.*

***Jungle Rulers.*** These small, intelligent, squirrel-like humanoids live in reclusive, primitive societies deep in the jungle. They are omnivorous, subsisting on fruits and roots, insects and larvae, bird and snake eggs, and birds and small mammals. They sometimes barter with more advanced creatures for metal and crafted items.

***Nocturnal Gliders.*** Lemurfolk are nocturnal, though they can adopt daytime hours when they must. They prefer to hunt and move by gliding between trees, catching prey off guard.

***Greyfur Elders.*** Greyfurs are the eldest and most revered kaguani, as much as 80 years old; their age can be estimated by the graying of their fur, but they don't track the years. Greyfurs are cunning individuals and command the arcane arts, though they rarely pursue the art of necromancyâ€”a strong taboo prohibits them from interacting with the dead.

A typical lemurfolk stands 2 feet tall and weighs 30 lb.

>
>***Dropped Boulder.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 100 ft. (vertically), one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.

## Moss Lurker

*Somewhat like the cruel crossbreed of troll and gnome, the moss lurkers are a primitive race of forest and cavern dwellers with long, greenish beards and hair. Their hides are mossy green or peaty amber, and a vaguely fungal scent surrounds them at all times.*

Like their trollish relatives, moss lurkers have large and often grotesque noses. Their claws are bright red when unsheathed, and their teeth tend toward the long and snaggly. They wear simple clothes of homespun wool or leather, or go naked in the summer. Their hats are sometimes festooned with toadstools or ferns as primitive camouflage.

***Rocks and Large Weapons.*** Moss lurkers have a fondness for throwing stones onto enemies from a great height, and they often employ enormous axes, warhammers, and two-handed swords that seem much larger than such a small creature should be able to lift.

>
>***Jelly Symbiosis..*** A creature that touches the mydnari or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage.  
>
>***Ooze Empathy..*** A mydnari can use its Animal Handling skill on ooze-type creatures with an Intelligence score of 5 or lower. An ooze never attacks a mydnari unless provoked.  
>

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Mydnari

*This tall, lanky humanoid is sightless, its eyes nothing more than useless spots in its otherwise human face. The creature is encased in a sheath of thick orange jelly, almost as if it had been dipped in a giant pot of honey. The jelly wobbles and slides over the creature's body as if alive.****Sightless Alchemists.*** The mydnari are an eyeless, evil subterranean race that lives alongside oozes. They delight in capturing other creatures and using the creatures for experimentation or as food for their colonies of oozes and slimes. They constantly experiment with new serums, tonics, and concoctions, striving to always improve themselves and their connection with their oozes.

***Bound in Jelly.*** Each mydnari enters into a symbiotic relationship with a mutated strain of **ochre jelly** as soon as it is born. This is a sacred rite among the mydnari, and without this link a mydnari is cast out and soon succumbs to the elements. The mydnari provides long-term sustenance for the jelly, and the jelly provides the sightless mydnari with protection and the ability to better sense its environment.

***Oozing Cities.*** The cities of the mydnari are dominated by flowing spires and twisting walkways, and they are always bathed in a sickly yellow-green radiance. Oozes and slimes are found almost everywhere, whether simply wandering along the street to clean up refuse or serving as living baths for mydnari nobles. Their cities also boast a large section dedicated to alchemy, and the sulfurous and sometimes noxious odors from the many alchemical labs float through the city for all to smell.

***Detested Necessity.*** The mydnari are viewed with revulsion by duergar and other subterranean races who rely on their alchemy. Only derro and **aboleths** are known to tolerate the mydnari for any length of time.

***Oozebound Nature.*** A mydnari doesn't require sleep.

## Nkosi

*With a thick mane of beaded locks, these powerful-looking bestial humanoids grin with a huge mouthful of pointed teethâ€”as befits a shapeshifter that can turn into a noble lion.*

***Beads and Braids.*** The nkosi resemble bestial humans with cat's eyes, slender tails, and the fangs and fur of a lion. Most grow their hair long, braiding colorful beads into their locks to mark important events in their lives. Although the nkosi's true form is that of a feline humanoid with leonine features, the most striking feature of the nkosi is their ability to change their shape, taking the form of a lion. Although comfortable in the wilds, nkosi can adapt to any environment.

***Clawlike Blades.*** In combat, they favor curved blades, wielded in a brutal fighting style in concert with snapping lunges using their sharp teeth. They prefer light armor decorated with bone beads, fetishes, and similar tokens taken from beasts they've slain.

***Pridelords.*** Nkosi pridelords are exceptionally tall and muscular members of the race, and they are leaders among their kin. Pridelords feature impressive manes but they are more famous for their powerful roar, which wakes the feral heart inside all members of this race.

## Noctiny

*A grinning man brandishes a staff surmounted by a rune-covered skull. Blasphemous sigils adorn his clothes, and ashes stain his skin a sickly gray.*

Noctiny are wretched humanoids corrupted by fell power. Their skin is sallow and gaunt even before they smear it with ash, bone dust, and worse materials to wash all living color from their bodies. The noctiny embrace all manner of blasphemous and taboo behaviors to please their masters.

***Pyramid of Power.*** The noctiny's lust for power drives them away from decency and reason. They are initiates who form the lowest rung of fext society. They swear themselves into service to the undead fext as thugs, servants, acolytes, and cannon fodder, and in exchange draw a trickle of power for themselves.

***A Race Apart.*** Though they arise from any humanoid stock, the noctiny are corrupted by the powers they serve. Noctiny retain the cosmetic traits that identify their original race if one looks hard enough, but any connection they once had to their fellows is overpowered by their transformation into noctiny.

## Otterfolk

*Brown fur covers the entire surface of this humanoid, which also has the black nose and small ears of an otter. Its piecemeal leather armor and weapon at the ready give the impression it is prepared for a fight.****Foe to Reptilians.*** While generally peaceful creatures, otterfolk bear an enmity for reptilians, owing to their near extinction in the jaws of giant alligators and other large swamp predators. They are wary of intelligent reptilian creatures, such as lizardfolk and naga, who regularly prey on their people. Otterfolk pass this animosity on to future generations through tales of heroic otterfolk overcoming ferocious snakes and mighty alligators. From the time an otterfolk kit can walk, it learns how to wield the atlatl and to be mindful of the presence of their hated foes. Otterfolk are wary of reptilian visitors or those accompanied by reptiles, but they are cordial to all others.

***Swamp Guides.*** Otterfolk are excellent sources of information about the territory surrounding their homes, and they often escort friendly visitors through the swamp. The price for this service depends on the combat capabilities of those they escort. Their overwhelming martial outlook causes them to value visitors who can prove themselves in combat. If a group seems capable of protecting itself, the otterfolk reason they don't have to defend the group in addition to guiding it. They often ask such groups for a pittance in rations or monetary value (preferring pearls to other valuable items). Otterfolk greatly increase their fees for groups apparently incapable of fighting off potential swamp hazards. However, they pride themselves on never abandoning their charges.

***Otter Trainers.*** Otterfolk often raise river otters as guard animals and pets, which serve the same function in their society as dogs in human societies. Otterfolk regard the animals warmly and become sad when favored pets die. They rarely allow their otters to engage in combat. They regularly hold contests where otter owners show off their training prowess by directing their otters in feats of strength, cunning, and dexterity. These contests never involve pitting the otters against each other in combat. The rare few otterfolk who choose to become wizards take otters as familiars. Otterfolk rangers often raise larger river otter specimens (use the statistics of a **giant weasel**) and train them as companions.

## Ramag

*These few denizens of a blasted desert waste now huddle in the remains of an ancient cityâ€”a city magically scattered across hundreds of miles.*

***Once Human.*** The ramag were a powerful tribe of dimensional sorcerers allied with a great society of titans, and they were indeed human in ages past. Over time, strange practices warped them into their current state, and they are clearly no longer purely human. Their limbs grow too long in proportion to their bodies, giving them a stooped, odd posture. Their features are angular, and a ramag's hair is impossibly thick; each strand is the width of a human finger. They wear their strange hair tied back in decorative clasps.

***Portal Network.*** The ramag used their innate magical gifts to maintain powerful magical conduits, ley lines that crisscrossed the titan's empire. This mastery of arcane might allowed instantaneous travel to the farthest-flung outpost. The ramag still maintain a network of magical monoliths that connect the scattered districts of their home, but this network is frayed and fading.

***Studious and Powerful.*** Although physically weak, the ramag are sharp-witted, studious, and naturally infused with magic. Lifetimes of exposure to the warping effect of their runaway magical energy have given the ramag innate control over magic, as well as sharp resistance to it. They are acutely aware of their responsibility for keeping magic in check, and fully know the danger of uncontrolled magical energies. Even the the lowliest ramag has a sharp intellect and a natural understanding of magic.

Many ramag take up the study of wizardry. Few become wandering adventurers, but well-equipped expeditions sometimes leave their homeland to inspect the surrounding countryside.

> ##### Ramag in Midgard
>The ramag all live within the twelve scattered districts of their home city, Ramagani (home, in their dialect), with 11 districts in the Abandoned Lands of the Southlands and one on an island off the coast. Though the districts are far apart, the ramag consider them all part of one great metropolis. The inhabited districts are guarded by powerful ramag spellcasters and by the Stormwatchâ€”a garrison of arcane warriors who operate enchanted lightning ballistae in defense of the city. (A lightning ballista functions identically to a standard ballista but does an additional 1d10 lightning damage with each hit.)

## Ratfolk

*Ratfolk are the size of halflings, though smaller in girth and quicker in their movements. At a glance they might even be mistaken for halflings if not for their twitching snouts, bony feet, and long, pink tails.*

The ratfolk are canny survivors, rogues and tricksters all. Their strong family ties make it easy for them to found or join criminal societies--though others serve as expert scouts and saboteurs, able to infiltrate army camps, city sewers, and even castle dungeons with equal ease. Ratfolk leaders are often spellcasters and rogues.

***Adaptable.*** Ratfolk swim well and can survive on little. Some groups are endemic to tropical and subtropical islands. Others inhabit forests, sewers, labyrinths, and ancient, ruined cities.

***Fast Fighters.*** Ratfolk prefer light weapons and armor, fighting with speed and using numbers to bring a foe down. They have been known to ally themselves with goblins, darakhul, and kobolds on occasion, but more often prefer to serve a "Rat King" who may or may not be a rat of any kind. Such rat rulers might include a wererat, a rat king, an ogre, a minor demon or intelligent undead.

## Ravenfolk Doom Croaker

*While a huginn's face resembles that of a great raven or crow, it lacks wings and has a much more solid frame. Most are pitch black, although a smattering have white feathers and red flecks.*

The ravenfolk are an avian race of scoundrels, schemers, and sneaksâ€”and they are much more than that. Long ago when Odin brokered the truce that brought peace among the gods, the wily deity magically created the ravenfolk from feathers plucked from his ravens Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory.) He placed this new race into the world alongside elves, dwarves, humans, and others to be his spies.

***Odin's Children.*** To this day, the ravenfolk are Odin's agents and embody his thought and memory. They are thieves of objects, yes, but primarily, they are thieves of secrets. Their black feathers and long beaks are spotted on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers, but when the ravenfolk swear an oath, they abide by it.

Odin grants the best of his ravenfolk magical runespears and runestaves, two-handed heavy weapons enchanted to serve his messengers. These function as long spears or quarterstaves in the hands of other races. The ravenfolk consider them special tokens meant for their use, and no one else's.

***Flightless but Bold.*** Though they have no wings and normally cannot fly, the physiology of ravenfolk is strikingly similar to that of true avians. They stand roughly 5 ft. tall and, because of their hollow bones, weigh just 95â€“105 lb. Albino ravenfolk are found in southern climates.

Ravenfolk eat almost anything, but they prefer raw meat and field grains, such as corn, soy, and alfalfa. They even scavenge days-old carrion, a practice that repulses most other humanoids.

***Feather Speech.*** The huginn have their own language, and they have another language which they may use as well: the language of feathers, also known as Feather Speech or Pinion. Ravenfolk can communicate volumes without speaking a word through the dyeing, arrangement, preening, and rustling of their plumage. This language is inherent to ravenfolk and not teachable to unfeathered races.

> ##### Ravenfolk in Midgard
>If the ravenfolk of Midgard have a homeland, it is Beldestan to the East; or on a branch of Wotan's tree in the North; or a high cliff of Horus' hidden temple in the South. They have settlements in Trollheim, Vidim, Domovogrod, Zobeck, Nuria Natal, and the Dragon Empire, but none are large.
>
>They avoid the West and the Seven Cities most of the time, and are most honored in Nuria Natal, where they serve the temples of Horus as sworn guardians, assassins and seekers of forgotten arcana. Some are said to be members of the Emerald Order, a society devoted to arcane mysteries.

## Roachling Lord

*The creature is humanoid but disturbingly roachlike. Its legs are too short, its arms too long, its skin is oily, and its back is covered by a carapace. Atop those features sits an incongruously humanlike face.*

Combining the worst of human and cockroach qualities, these nimble creatures have a talent for stealth and for fighting dirty. Also known as scuttlers, roachlings are an unpleasant humanoid raceâ€”inquisitive and covetous, unclean and ill-manneredâ€”and most other races shun them.

***Devious Combatants.*** Roachlings are skittish and easily frightened, but they aren't cowards. Rather, they are practical about their weaknesses. They understand survival often depends on remaining unseen and out of reach. Most roachlings prefer to fight only when the chance for victory sits squarely on their side.

They also have a well-deserved reputation for deviousness. Roachlings are adept at skulking, underhanded tactics, and hit.and-run fighting. Filth and trickery are their most useful tools.

***Deeply Paranoid.*** Because they have long been hunted and persecuted, roachlings are naturally suspicious, and they extend their trust slowly. A deep-rooted paranoia infects the race, and unsurprisingly their paranoia often turns out to be justified.

***Fused Carapace.*** Roachlings have prominent, whip-like antennae, a carapace covering much of their backs, and small spines on their legs and arms. They have short, noticeably bowed legs. Hair is unusual among roachlings, but when present, it's always oily and dark, pressed flat against the skull.

Roachling coloration varies across tan, yellow, dark brown, and black. Regardless of color, their thick, hardened skin appears shiny and slightly oily although it is dry. Roachlings have an internal skeleton, however, not the exoskeleton of a true insect.

## Roachling Skirmisher

*The creature is humanoid but disturbingly roachlike. Its legs are too short, its arms too long, its skin is oily, and its back is covered by a carapace. Atop those features sits an incongruously humanlike face.*

## Satarre Destroyer

*The muscled reptilian swings its mighty axe at angels and fiends alike on the front lines of a reptilian army.*The largest and strongest of the satarre, destroyers hold the shield wall and strike down their enemies throughout the planes. These hulking specimens wear banded or scaled armor, often with a glistening varnish finish. Their most common weapons include spears, heavy polearms, and axes.

***Shield Wall.*** Large squads and companies of satarre destroyers often use void magic to create crackling, violet shield walls. When they do, the destroyers stand shoulder to shoulder, their shields overlapping, and prevent enemies from advancing past them to the **mystics** they protect.

***Necrotic Lore.*** Satarre destroyers are well-versed in necromantic magic and other arcana, although they do not perform it themselves. They often find and use magical items looted from their victims, or command undead minions using Void Speech.

## Satarre Mystic

*Dressed in clean, dark robes, its claws swirling in arcane gestures, the pale reptilian sends a bolt of energy from the Void at its foes.*Satarre mystics are creatures with tight awareness of nearby living creatures' fates. They rely on magic and the ability to speak words of decay to control lesser creatures. Mystics' minds are always turned to destruction and death, though they hold their own lives more dear than that of their fellow satarres, be they non-combatant drones, rampaging **destroyers**, or others.

***Easily Distracted.*** Satarre mystics are known for their ability to ponder and cogitate on larger concerns, even in the midst of a conversation with strangers or a battle with foes. Sometimes these distractions lead them to a great insight and a clever countermove; other times they are easily surprised, captured, or fooled by a shining bit of magic or an unknown arcane device.

***Perpetual Incantations.*** Satarre mystics seem to somehow maintain a steady stream of muttered sounds. Sometimes these take a brief physical form, such as a glowing rune of destruction that circles a mystic's head or drifts from its maker and falls apart in midair.

***Planar Lore and Tools.*** Satarre mystics are well-versed in angelic, elemental, and fiendish magic and other arcana, although they do not perform all of these themselves. They often find and use magical items looted from their victims, or command elemental or fiendish minions using Void Speech.

On special missions, their cell leader, scorpion cultists might doff their traditional garb and infiltrate towns or cities.

## Shadow Fey

*Kind words open even iron doors*â€” Twilight, a courtier to the shadow fey

To most, the shadow fey are little more than a dancing shadow among the leaves. To savants, they are the creatures that taught the shadowdancers all they know, and kept many secrets to themselves. They were once elves like all others, dwelling in mortal lands beneath the sun. An ancient catastrophe drove them to darkness, and now they are creatures of the shadow. Though they can be found on the Material Plane, they are inextricably tied to the plane of Shadows, and that is the seat of their power and culture.

Shadow fey superficially resemble other elves, but they're rarely mistaken for their lighted cousins. Skin tones among the shadow fey range from alabaster white to ebony black, with varying shades of gray in between, but they are otherwise lacking in color. A few have a scintillating shimmer to their skin. Many shadow fey grow horns that sweep out from their hair, varying in size from subtle nubs to obvious spikes. Others have shocking sets of teeth.

***Dual Natured.*** The shadow fey are contradictory beings. They boast some of the best features of elves, tempered by aspects of a fouler nature. They can be deliberate and purposeful, but they're also given to perplexing whimsy. Mortal creatures trying to fathom shadow fey motivations are in for a maddening experience; they are often illogical, capricious, and seemingly thrive on annoying others.

***Split Rulership.*** The Summer Court and Winter Court each rule the shadow fey in the appropriate season. The turning of these seasons follows no clear calendar or schedule, though it is skewed toward summer. The Queen of Night and Magic and the Moonlit King each claim dominion in turn, ruling over the Summer and Winter courts respectively.

Other fey call them the ScÃ¡thsidhe (pronounced scAH-shee), or shadow faeries, and they are usually counted among the unseelie, though they would dispute that characterization. They simply call themselves part of the sidhe, and consider themselves an extension of the Seelie Court.

***The Reach of Darkness.*** Their bond with darkness allows the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing darkness itself from one place to another. Not only can every shadow fey slip from a shadow or patch of darkness to instantly appear elsewhere, they also control the mysterious and powerful shadow roads. Shadow roads are magical pathways that connect points on the Material Plane by dipping through the plane of shadow, allowing rapid and completely secret travel for the feyâ€”and more importantly, for their weapons of war, their trade goods, and their allies.

The shadow fey all have an instinctive understanding of how a shadow road functions, and they are adept at both operating the entrance portals and navigating any hazards on the road. This bond with darkness has a price, of course, and the shadow fey shun the sun's light.

## Shadow Fey Duelist

The pale-skinned elf wears a gleaming breastplate and tight-fitting clothing. He moves like the wind, evading blows with effortless skill. When he stops and smiles, his blade is slick with crimson.

Shadow fey duelists are elite warriors, often of noble lineage. Swift and sure beyond compare, duelists are often taller and more wiry than others of their kind. Their armor, clothing, and weapons are of exquisite make, fashioned from only the finest materials, as befits their station.

A nobleman or woman of the shadow fey is not to be taken lightlyâ€”many courtiers or politicians are deadly with their slim blades, and they are known to distill virulent poisons. Often a skilled duelist serves as a champion for her liege, standing in the noble's stead in challenges or serving as an elite bodyguard.

This effect ends if the enchantress is incapacitated.

## Shadow Fey Enchantress

This ravishing shadow fey woman moves with alluring grace. Her voice rings like a bell, and in her hearing worldly cares and sorrows melt away.

Beyond even great physical beauty, the sheer presence of a shadow fey enchantress can lay the most stalwart foes low. Enchantresses live up to their name; almost universally female, they are beautiful beyond compare. Only if they wish it could they ever be mistaken for common shadow fey.

Enchantresses are also powerful spellcasters who infuse their words and manner with the beguiling power of shadow to turn enemies against one another with a few words and a deadly smile. They augment the force of their minds with fey-wrought blades, infusing their weapons with power that shreds their victims' psyche as well as their flesh.

## Shadow Fey Forest Hunter

Forest Hunter The shadows flicker slightly, and that's the only warning before a hail of arrows erupts from the concealed, black-skinned elf hidden in the gloom.

Dressed in exquisitely wrought mail and leather jerkins, forest hunters are even more lithe and graceful than most shadow fey. Physically, only their mannerisms and skills setting them apart from other shadow feyâ€”usually too late.

Forest hunters roam the deep woods connected to shadow roads, as well as the dark reflections within the plane of Shadows. They are skilled trackers and stalkers, hunting animals and more dangerous game. Many forest hunters serve in the Wild Hunt, and a hunter that has at one time ridden at the Lord of the Hunt's side is afforded great respect, even fear, because of the common belief that such a hunter can implore the Lord of the Hunt to notice an enemy.

# Shadow Fey
*Kind words open even iron doors*â€” Twilight, a courtier to the shadow feyTo most, the shadow fey are little more than a dancing shadow among the leaves. To savants, they are the creatures that taught the shadowdancers all they know, and kept many secrets to themselves. They were once elves like all others, dwelling in mortal lands beneath the sun. An ancient catastrophe drove them to darkness, and now they are creatures of the shadow. Though they can be found on the Material Plane, they are inextricably tied to the plane of Shadows, and that is the seat of their power and culture.

Shadow fey superficially resemble other elves, but they're rarely mistaken for their lighted cousins. Skin tones among the shadow fey range from alabaster white to ebony black, with varying shades of gray in between, but they are otherwise lacking in color. A few have a scintillating shimmer to their skin. Many shadow fey grow horns that sweep out from their hair, varying in size from subtle nubs to obvious spikes. Others have shocking sets of teeth.

***Dual Natured.*** The shadow fey are contradictory beings. They boast some of the best features of elves, tempered by aspects of a fouler nature. They can be deliberate and purposeful, but they're also given to perplexing whimsy. Mortal creatures trying to fathom shadow fey motivations are in for a maddening experience; they are often illogical, capricious, and seemingly thrive on annoying others.

***Split Rulership.*** The Summer Court and Winter Court each rule the shadow fey in the appropriate season. The turning of these seasons follows no clear calendar or schedule, though it is skewed toward summer. The Queen of Night and Magic and the Moonlit King each claim dominion in turn, ruling over the Summer and Winter courts respectively.

Other fey call them the ScÃ¡thsidhe (pronounced scAH-shee), or shadow faeries, and they are usually counted among the unseelie, though they would dispute that characterization. They simply call themselves part of the sidhe, and consider themselves an extension of the Seelie Court.

***The Reach of Darkness.*** Their bond with darkness allows the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing darkness itself from one place to another. Not only can every shadow fey slip from a shadow or patch of darkness to instantly appear elsewhere, they also control the mysterious and powerful shadow roads. Shadow roads are magical pathways that connect points on the Material Plane by dipping through the plane of shadow, allowing rapid and completely secret travel for the feyâ€”and more importantly, for their weapons of war, their trade goods, and their allies.

The shadow fey all have an instinctive understanding of how a shadow road functions, and they are adept at both operating the entrance portals and navigating any hazards on the road. This bond with darkness has a price, of course, and the shadow fey shun the sun's light.

## Shadow Fey Guardian

A hulking brute, this shadow fey towers over his fellows and wields massive weapons. Patches of his body are swallowed by inky blackness that writhes and crawls, distorting his form in places, and his eyes are hollow black pits.

Shadow fey guardians are massive creatures trained and bred for battle. They appear as massive versions of shadow fey, but the stuff of shadow corrupts them even more than their brethren, expanding their size and power to an ogrish strength. Patches of pitch black shadow swallow parts of their body and crawl about, revealing and obscuring more by inches at a time. They stand nearly 10 feet tall and weigh over 700 pounds.

Guardians are fanatically loyal to their superiors. Employed as house guards or even personal bodyguards for important shadow fey, guardians are unshakable in their duty. The shadow corruption reaches into their minds and souls, so that not even powerful magic can bend their hearts or break their resolve. Guardians aren't independent thinkers, but they discharge their duty with single-minded dedication.

>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The ssadar makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its longsword. Alternatively, it can use Spit Fire twice.  
>
>***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.  
>
>***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.

## Ssadar

*This bipedal reptilian creature has scales of gold that turn to red in the shadow. It has clawed hands but wields a sword. Its breath smells of brimstone, and a hint of smoke can be seen escaping through its nostrils.****Jungle Dwellers.*** The ssadar dwell in the jungle and rarely travel to other climates. They prefer the heat, the moisture, and the cover provided by the jungle foliage, though they are capable of surviving in the desert. They live in small cities, usually at the base of mountains near abundant water sources, and they closely monitor the surrounding regions to make sure that non-ssadar are not attempting to approach. Those who make their way towardâ€”or, more rarely, intoâ€”their cities are attacked. If captured, intruders are usually sacrificed to their evil lizard gods.

***Pyramid Builders.*** The ssadar are builders of terraced pyramids with engravings of dragons and their lizard gods. These are temples where they congregate, worship, and perform ritual sacrifices. Most of their cities are built around these magnificent structures, though abandoned pyramids can also be found in the trackless depths of the jungle. The entrance to these structures is at the top, and each of them contains a multi-level labyrinth of chambers inside.

***One with Fire.*** Ssadars have an affinity for fire and hold beings of fire in high esteem. Ssadar priests bless ssadar warriors by imbuing them with fire before sending them into battle. A non-ssadar fire-wielder who enters a ssadar city might earn enough respect from the ssadar to be sacrificed last or in a grander ritual to the greatest of their gods.

## Subek

*For most of the year the subek are a kindly race, advising others and lending their physical and intellectual prowess to local projects. During the flood season, however, subek become violent and territorial, ruthlessly killing and consuming all trespassers.*

***Riverbank Homes.*** Subek are crocodile-headed humanoids that dwell along the banks of great rivers. They are tailless, possessing muscular physiques, surprisingly dexterous hands, and a frightening maw of sharp teeth. They are 9 feet tall, average 700 lb., and can live up to 300 years.

During the dry season, subek are friendly, thoughtful scholars, historians, and artisans.

***Flood Fever.*** Subek are well aware of their destructive and violent nature. When the waters rise, they distance themselves from other cultures, warning locals to keep away until the river recedes. Most migrate up or down river to an area with few inhabitants; some even construct underground prisons or cages and pay brave retainers to keep them locked up and fed during their time of savagery.

During flood fever, subek do not recognize friends or colleagues. They discard all trappings of civilization and kill nonsubek creatures indiscriminately. Once the fever clears, they remember nothing of their actions, though they are surrounded by undeniable, grisly reminders.

***Keep Their Distance.*** Despite the danger, subek are tolerated and even prized for their skill as engineers, historians, and teachers. They live on the outskirts of many human towns, maintaining a cautious distance from their neighbors. Subek marriage is pragmatic; they live with a mate long enough to foster a single egg and raise the hatchling for a decade before parting ways.

Subek scholars and oracles debate their duality. Some believe it to be an ancient curse, a shared ancestry with northern trolls, or some loathsome and primitive part of their soul exerting control. A rare fewâ€”shamans and oracles, mostlyâ€”embrace their duality and choose to live year-round in remote regions far from civilization.

>
>***Terrifying Display (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The sulsha beats furiously on its chest and hollers with rage. Each creature within 30 feet of the sulsha that can see or hear it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Sulsha

*Larger than a gorilla, this monstrous ape is covered in bright-red fur. It has twin tufts of black hair rising from its head like horns and possesses a bony spur on the end of its long, meaty tail. The creature's eyes glow with evil intelligence, and it carries a bag filled with various incendiary devices.****Jungle Tyrants.*** Sulshas are tyrannical simian humanoids that dwell in thick jungles, particularly in hilly or mountainous regions. Obsessed with conquering those around them, sulshas are in a constant state of warfare with creatures that share their homeland. They even force their simian cousins, such as **kapi** ([Creature Codex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/collection/Kobold Press; Creature Codex.json)) and **vanara** ([Creature Codex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/collection/Kobold Press; Creature Codex.json)), into military service to use against their enemies. Sulshas treat the smaller simians as little more than expendable resources in their grand plans. Though the **Monkey King** ([Creature Codex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/collection/Kobold Press; Creature Codex.json)) frowns on and discourages the sulshas' poor treatment of their cousinsâ€”treatment the sulshas often deny or hide from the kingâ€”he values the sulshas' strength and dedication to protecting simian kind.

***Pyrotechnic Primates.*** Sulshas have an affinity for explosive devices. Some of their alchemists even rival those found in the largest cities, though they never take on non-simian apprentices. Every sulsha always has at least one explosive device on hand.

***Simian Supremacy.*** Sulshas see themselves as superior to most humanoids, whom they view as physically weak and morally bankrupt. They believe vanaras to be naive and idealistic, though they respect their cousins' wisdom, and they think of kapi as simple-minded and unpredictable but still better than humans. Sulshas who think otherwise are viewed with suspicion by their community and are ultimately banished or executed.

## Tosculi Elite Bow Raider

Tosculi elite bow raiders are smarter and more capable than drones and common warriors, with midnight black or deep green carapaces that shine with colorful iridescence. Their wings are blood red, streaked with dark crimson veins. Elite bow raiders also tower over common tosculiâ€”they stand over 5 feet tall and weigh 130 lb.

***Warband Leaders.*** Elite bow raiders lead larger raiding parties of warriors and drones to gather slaves and sacrifices. As rare and prized members of the hive, a bow raider's life is never thrown away like drones' or risked unnecessarily. Seldom does a tosculi warband contain more than a handful of these elite soldiers, and they frequently hold positions of command. Elite bow raiders always lead the honor guard for their hive-queen, both within the hive and on those rare occasions when the queen ventures outside.

## Trollkin Raider

*Screams echo in the night as spears meet wood and flesh. One trollkin pulls its spear from its latest victim while its companion raids the victim's larder.*Trollkin raiders are greedy and efficient, moving together under the command of a trollkin leader to take apart a village, a caravan, or a small fortress. Their goal is generally food and portable wealth. Their training as a unit is not extensive but raiders know, trust, and fight for one another.

***Night Attacks.*** Trollkin raiders attack in a fast-moving, nocturnal group, often using a group of panicked animals or a fire as a distraction in one place while they attack elsewhere. Their assaults are never daylight attacks over open ground; they much prefer surprise and the confusion of night attacks.

***Mounted or River Routes.*** While trollkin raiders can lope for miles across taiga or through forests, they far prefer to ride horses or row up a river. It gives them both speed and the ability to carry more plunder.

## Trollkin Reaver

*In the north the masses huddle in fear at night, dreading the horns and howls of reavers come to slaughter and pillage. The trollkin reaver's skin is thick and knobby, and it sports wicked talons and tusks.*

***Fearsome Savages.*** Trollkin have a well-deserved reputation for savagery, and the reavers help reinforce that perception among their neighbors.

***War Leaders.*** Raiding is a staple industry among the trollkin, and the reavers lead the most savage raiding parties in search of wealth, slaves, and supplies. They often recruit other creatures or mercenaries into their bands. It is not uncommon to see bloodthirsty humans, gnolls, or hobgoblins in a reaver's band.

***Spirit Talkers.*** Trollkin reavers are quite fearful of spirits and ghosts, and listen to their clan shaman and to the word of powerful fey or giants. They prefer to raid only in times of good omens.

## Wereowl

*This feathered humanoid has piercing eyes, larger than normal for a humanoid's head, set around a sharp beak. Wings spread from its arms, and its feet end in wicked talons.*A wereowl is a hybrid creature usually in service to a powerful creature with dominion over flying creatures. The affinity between owls and elves means that most wereowls are elves, rather than the humans typical among other lycanthropes. The wereowl possesses the keen eyesight that is common to owls, as well as the birds' preternatural ability to fly silently. Its appetite tends toward its avian nature, and it feasts on rodents and other small mammals, usually raw and directly after a successful hunt. Its attitudes toward rodents extends to **wererats** and rodent-like creatures, such as ratfolk, and it often prefers to attack such creatures to the exclusion of other foes.

## Wereshark

*The twisted form of a humanoid shark hunches over, its grin showing rows of jagged teeth. Fresh blood drips from its mouth as it clutches a trident in powerful hands.*In humanoid form, weresharks tend to be powerfully-muscled and broad, with little body hair. They are solitary hunters who sometimes stalk and eat each other. If a wereshark spreads its curse, it's likely because the lycanthrope made a mistake and let potential prey get away.

***Voracious Appetites.*** Weresharks are savage predators who, driven by voracious appetites, devour anything they come across. Aggressive in all forms, weresharks prefer to spend their time beneath the waves, hunting fish, seals, and other prey. They have no qualms about attacking humanoids or boats, particularly fishing vessels, which contain even more food for the lycanthrope to consume.

***Obsessed Predators.*** Weresharks become obsessed with prey that gets away from them. A wereshark can stalk an individual through the seas and over land for months, leaving a path of destruction behind it, just to get a taste of what it missed.

>***Precognition (Recharge 6).*** When a creature the yathon can see hits it with a melee attack, the attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. Alternatively, when the yathon misses with a melee weapon attack, it can reroll the attack roll with advantage.

## Yathon

*This large, bestial-looking creature is dark gray, with powerful muscles, long arms, sharp claws at the end of five-digit fingers, fine, short fur, and enormous, bat-like wings. Its face is an odd combination of orc and bat. Its brows are heavy, its nose is a snout, and its mouth is full of sharp teeth. Its ears are tall and pointed.****Distantly Related to Orcs.*** Yathon seem to have just as much in common with bats as they have with orcs. Their species is a seemingly perfect melding of the two, as they have the power and ferocity of the orc but the communal nature, flying, and sonic perception of a bat. It is unknown if they are the product of some mad wizard's experiment or if they are simply cousins of orcs.

***Communal.*** Yathon live in communities of ten to twenty. They are brutal and tribal in nature, and they fight ferociously. Yathon often capture prey in their claws, carry it into the air, and drop it from great heights. Despite their primitive tactics, they have a minor precognition that aids them in battle. This precognition seems to be driven by instinct as much as anything else, but many believe it was a gift from some god.

>***Timewarped Body.*** At the start of each of the zeitgeist's turns, roll a die. On an even roll, its body stretches and speeds up as it takes on a darting form. On an odd roll, its body becomes more solid and slows down as it takes on a sluggish form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except as noted here.  
>**Darting Form.** While in a Darting form, the zeitgeist's Armor Class increases by 2, and its speed is 40 feet.  
>**Sluggish Form.** While in a Sluggish form, the zeitgeist has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and its speed is 20 feet.

>
>***Tormented Scream (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The zeitgeist cries out, releasing some of its internal torment in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
>
>### Reactions
>***Rewind (Recharge 4â€“6).*** When the zeitgeist takes damage or when it starts its turn afflicted with a condition, it can rewind time around it, preventing the damage or undoing the condition. It can use this reaction even while paralyzed or stunned.

## Zeitgeist

*The mumbling humanoid alternates between bursts of speed and inactivity as it struggles to focus on the reality around it.*Caught in a chronological maelstrom, zeitgeists struggle to interact with whatever reality presents itself in that moment. Zeitgeists are humanoids who were warped by some misuse or accident of time magic. They are "ghosts" of time, flittering from plane to plane, timeline to timeline, unable to anchor themselves with any sort of stability for long.

***Fast and Slow.*** Warped by time magic, a zeitgeist finds itself alternating between speeding around its foes and being barely able to keep up with them. This alternating is random and outside of the zeitgeist's control, often pulling it forward in the middle of a conversation or slowing it when attempting to escape an enemy.

***Unstable Body and Mind.*** The constant instability of being pulled between planes and timelines leaves zeitgeists unable to focus, at best, and deranged, at worst. If a moment of clarity pierces its madness, a zeitgeist might attempt a quick conversation or simply remain motionless, enjoying the temporary reprieve from its tortured existence.

***Still Living.*** Though named "ghosts," zeitgeists aren't dead; rather, something mysterious about their situation sustains them. Similar to a **ghost**, a zeitgeist might be tied to a particular location, albeit at different points in time. The location might be the site of the magical mishap that created it, a place steeped in planar or time magic, or a place stable enough in time to help the zeitgeist anchor itself and its sanity.

***Timewarped Nature.*** A zeitgeist doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
