It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 10 minutes. The artillerist can dismiss it early as an action.  
>When the artillerist summons the turret, it decides which type it is, choosing from the options listed below:

>***1.*** Flamethrower. The turret exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

>
>***3.*** Defender. The turret emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it 8 (1d8 + 4) temporary hit points.  
>On each of its turns, the artillerist can take a bonus action to cause the turret to activate if it is within 60 feet of it. As part of the same action, the artillerist can direct the turret to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space.  
>The artillerist can use an action to command the turret to detonate if is within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the turret and forces each creature within 10 feet of it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Bugbear Beastlord

This cunning bugbear is a beast master who can command and summon **giant rats**, **wolves**, and **worgs**. It often leads hunting and raiding parties and serve as its tribes' foremost scout and tracker.

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

>- When it makes a melee weapon attack, the bugbear gains a +2 bonus to the damage roll (included in the attack.
>- The bugbear has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

## Bugbear Blood Ghost Berserker

These bloodthirsty bugbears paint themselves with gray-white colored dyes to signify that they walk in the afterlife and, thus, do not fear death. They charge howling into combat, driven by their inner rage. Blood ghost berserkers are prized as bodyguards and are often found directly serving goblinoid leaders.

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

## Bugbear Boss

The imposing bugbear boss is the skilled and wily veteran warrior who often leads a gang of goblinoids. In combat, it gives tactical commands to its underlings while waiting for an opportunity to crush the skulls of its foes.

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

## Bugbear Dark Claw of Skiggaret

Skigarret is a hateful bugbear demigod of death, terror, and torture that resembles an 8-foot tall shadowy goblin with lips and hands and feet soaked in blood. The dark claw is an insidious warlock that worships Skiggaret. It can conjure a cloak of tenebrous tendrils around itself that can strike fear to anyone near it. The dark claw can also unleash shadowy claws that rakes and weakens any creature they hit.

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

## Bugbear Dread Eye of Grankhul

The dread eye is a devious and skilled priest-assassin who worships Grankhul, the bugbear deity of hunting, stealth, and surprise. The dread eye serves its tribe as its inquisitor and executioner. It never attacks in the open and rarely without the element of surprise, often taking advantage of its foes' inability to see in the dark. The dread eye specializes in spells and abilities that confuse, disorient, and incapacitate its foes in order to set them up for a quick kill.

## Bugbear Warlock

These bugbears are warlocks of the fiend and are able to cast devastating spells. They counsel their chieftains and leaders in subjects about the arcane, supernatural, and worship of demons.

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

## Bugbear Witch Doctor

The bugbear witch doctor mainly serves its tribe as its spiritual guide and healer. It is still a dangerous foe in combat because of its ability to charm, confuse, incapacitate, and curse its foes with its spells and abilities.

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

## Bullywug Boss

This tough bullywug is a cunning and opportunistic warrior that fights dirty. It usually leads small bullywug tribes and war parties.

Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.

Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.

***Foul Aristocracy.*** Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader-a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor.

A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.

***Unruly Diplomacy.*** Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.

Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a bullywug of unusually large size-and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its "guests" with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.

***Amphibian Allies.*** Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.

Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.

The bullywug can then take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a bonus action.

>

If the bullywug dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.  
>
>***Stunning Croak (Recharge 5–6).*** The bullywug emits a magical stupefying croak. Each creature not a bullywug within 20 feet of the bullywug and can hear the bullywug must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute.

## Bullywug Maw of Ramenos

This monstrous, towering bullywug is blessed with the essence of Ramenos, a primordial bullywug deity. The Maw of Ramenos appears as an 8-foot tall bullywug with an oversized mouth, enabling it to swallow its foes and unleash a thunderous croak.

Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.

Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.

Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.

***Foul Aristocracy.*** Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader-a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor.

A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.

***Unruly Diplomacy.*** Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.

Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a bullywug of unusually large size-and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its "guests" with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.

***Amphibian Allies.*** Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.

Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.

## Bullywug Swarm Leader

The swarm leader is a cunning shaman that unites several bullywug tribes under one banner. It combat, it uses an array of powerful water spells.

A poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

>***Shapechanger.*** At night, the buso can use its action to polymorph into its Fiend Form or back into its true form, which is humanoid. In Fiend Form, the buso appears as a ghoul-like humanoid. Its statistics, other than its Speed, damage, and damage resistances, are the same in each form. It reverts to its true form at dawn or if it dies. While transformed, the buso also gains the following features:  
>- The buso's creature type changes to fiend.
>- The buso has advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
>- When it makes a melee weapon attack, the buso gains a +3 bonus to the damage roll (included in the attack).
>- The buso can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
>- If the buso starts its turn within 10 feet of a pound of salt or garlic, it becomes poisoned until the start of its next turn.
>
>***Keen Hearing And Smell.*** The buso has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.  
>
>***Unnerving Chatter (Fiend Form Only).*** Any creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of at least 3 busos that aren't incapacitated and can hear the busos must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the busos for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the buso's Unnerving Chatter for the next 24 hours.  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The buso makes one attack with its Dagger (humanoid form) or two attacks. one with its Bite and one with its Claws (fiend form).  
>
>***Bite (Fiend Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the buso gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.  
>
>***Claws (Fiend Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage.  
>
>***Dagger (Humanoid Form Only).*** *Melee  or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.  
>
>***Shadow Step (Fiend Form Only).*** As a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, the buso teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is also in dim light or darkness. It then has advantage on the first melee attack it makes before the end of the turn.

## Buso

### Buso (Boo-soh)
The buso, also called bhuts in other regions, is a malevolent and rapacious aswang with gluttonous tendencies. It is skinny and twitchy in humanoid form, with an unusually large and foul-smelling mouth and bloodshot eyes. In its fiend form, the buso resembles a ghoulish creature with leathery skin, wild, unkempt hair, flat nostrils, and an oversized mouth filled with rows of jagged teeth. Its gangly body has long, skinny limbs that end in large clawed hands and feet. The buso moves with a loping, feral gait.

***Buso Curse.*** A humanoid becomes afflicted by the buso curse in four ways: One, by being cursed by a **barrow hag**. Second, after being bitten by a **tigbanua**. Third, by being born into it. Lastly, when a humanoid who has lived as a cannibal enters into a pact with **Orcus**, the Prince of Undeath.

***Living Ghouls.*** While busos will eat fresh meat, they prefer eating carrion because to them it tastes like a delicacy. By day, busos work as gravediggers, cemetery groundskeepers, embalmers, and priests, allowing them easy access to cadavers. At night, they act like ghouls, congregating as packs and prowling catacombs, cemeteries, and graveyards. They create a disturbing cacophony of chattering sounds with their teeth and claws, which can instill fear in anyone who hears it. They dig out the dead and ravenously eat their decomposing flesh, drink whatever blood is left, and suck the marrows from their bones.

There are rumors of an aristocratic family of busos that host a party every full moon. They entertain their guests with fine cuisine, orgies, and other hedonistic indulgences during the day. By nightfall, the family reveal their true nature, slaughter their guests, and dine on their corpses in a lavish banquet hall.

### Aswang (Uh-swung)
An aswang is an accursed humanoid that transforms into a fiend. In its natural form, an aswang resembles a typical humanoid. At night, it can change its shape into a cunning, demonic predator. It hunts other humanoids and feasts on their blood, organs, or life force.

***Aswang Curse.*** A humanoid creature can be afflicted by the aswang curse after it willingly made or was tricked into making a dark pact with a Demon Lord, sometimes through the actions of a hag. One can also be born into it if one or both of its parents are aswangs. Casting *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or similar spell can free a humanoid of the curse, but a natural born aswang can only be freed of the curse with a *wish*. An aswang can either resist its curse or welcome it. By fighting the curse, an aswang keeps its normal behavior and personality while in its natural form. It can try to live its life as it wants but must constantly stave off the urge to feed. However, at nights of the full moon, the hunger becomes too great, and the curse overcomes the individual, forcing it to transform into its fiendish form. An aswang driven to this state becomes ravenous and will not stop hunting until it has fed. Each night that it fails to feed in its fiend form, it gains 1 level of exhaustion.

A genuinely depraved individual, or someone corrupted by it, sees the aswang curse as a gift and, over time, masters the ability to change into a fiend. However, an aswang can only transform at night and retain its demonic form until dawn, at which point it automatically transforms back to its humanoid form.

***Masters of Deception.*** Aswangs hide in plain sight, living amongst normal folk and often taking up occupations like butchers, hunters, gravediggers, taxidermists, and trappers to help divert suspicions of why their homes may sometimes smell of carrion and death. They insert themselves into humanoid communities and earn their neighbors' trust through charm, friendliness, and generosity. They avoid getting physically close to an individual, though, because if one looks directly at their eyes, they will discover that their reflection is upside down. Aswangs tend to prey on members of society that no one will miss if they suddenly disappear. If such targets are unavailable, they travel to another community, settlement, or location that is far from their homes. They won't risk feeding near where they live. Anyone who becomes suspicious of them, or sees them in their fiendish form, is always dealt with immediately for fear of rousing an organized mob. A successful clan of aswangs can live in the outskirts of town, preying on its citizens for years without getting caught. If things start to go awry, the aswangs will not risk staying. They will leave as soon as they can and establish themselves in another community to begin anew.

***Night Stalkers.*** Aswangs are careful, patient, and stealthy hunters, often choosing targets that are defenseless or weak. Typically during the day, aswangs pick and mark their target and identify where they live. At night after they transform, they stalk their prey and bide their time until they can attack when their target is most vulnerable. This means most of their assaults happen when their target is alone or asleep. They often just leave the bodies of their victims where they are to avoid the risk of getting caught. Because their kills bear specific types of wounds commonly attributed to ghouls, lycanthropes, or vampires, they aren't worried suspicions about their presence will be brought up.

***Aswang Weaknesses.*** Aswangs, much like vampires, have several weaknesses. They find the pungent smell of garlic repulsive, and the chemical properties of pure salt sicken it. While an aswang can resist most blows, weapons made from a stingray's barbed tail, even simple ones, can hurt them normally. Because they become fiends while transformed, they are susceptible to attacks that specifically harm fiends, such as holy water. If an aswang fails its saving throw against a *Dispel Evil and Good* spell, it reverts to its humanoid form and can't transform for 1 minute.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

## Gatorfolk

Gatorfolk are cruel and savage 8-feet tall reptilian humanoids with an osteodermic hide. Their heads, much like an alligator's, feature a U-shaped snout filled with serrated teeth. Small, beady yellow eyes sit on each side, covered in a transparent protective liquid layer that allows them to see even the slightest movements underwater.

***Well-Defended Lair.*** The brutish gatorfolk possess limited intelligence but speak Draconic and broken bits of Common. They live in a tribal-like hierarchy, led by a chieftain chosen from the strongest of the tribe. Their camp features simple thatched huts and thick wooden bridges built on swamps, marshes, and shallow parts of rivers. Snares, pits, and spear traps are littered around their territory to deter intruders and catch the occasional meal. Alligators and crocodiles, which the gatorfolk treat as pets, infest the waters around their homes.

***Rapacious Raiders.*** Gatorfolk usually hunt within their territory, lying submerged underwater in river banks near animal trails and roads. If food is scarce, they will form hunting parties and raid nearby humanoid settlements. They will eat almost anything that has meat but particularly favor the taste of bullywug, humans, and livestock.

***Reptilian Allies.*** Gatorfolk worship Sess'innek, who they believe is the first true gatorfolk that spawned their race before it became a demon lord. Gatorfolk may build alliances with lizardfolk, which they see as their kin. However, they bully and almost treat them as slaves. Gatorfolk have been known to work with black dragons, crocosphinxes, dracotaurs, evil naga, and yuan-ti, serving them as guards and mercenaries.

## Gnoll War Leader of Yeenoghu

The gnoll war leader is a fanatical commander who worships Yeenoghu. It can inspire ferocity in battle within its followers and empower its attacks with divine energy. What makes the war leader more dangerous, though, is its ability to project an aura of bloodlust. Any creature, even gnolls, caught within the aura are unable to control their feral instincts and become crazed and homicidal.

## Goblin Peacemaker of Bargrivyek

Bargrivyek is the goblin deity of cooperation and unity between goblinoid races. His favored high priests are known as Peacemakers, goblin warrior priests who encouraged teamwork between goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. In reality, they function more as pacifiers and resolvers of conflict between the goblinoid races. They are successful not because of their diplomatic abilities but because the other goblinoids, especially the bugbears, fear them more.

In combat, the peacemakers utilize their divine spells to control and dominate their enemies. In addition, they can paralyze a foe with a single strike of their flails.

## Goblin Watcher of Maglubiyet

Watchers are a branch of clergy that worship Maglubiyet that focused on protecting and guarding what was important to their goblin god. This includes safekeeping and watching over sacred goblinoid relics and treasures that their tribes have accumulated. They also serve as bodyguards to important goblinoid figures such as chieftains, high priests, and champions.

Maglubiyet bestows upon the watchers his fire spells as well as his "Fiery Eyes" gift, which enables them to cause creatures and objects they gaze at to spontaneously combust and burn.

## Halimaw

### Halimaw (Huh-lee-mou)
The vicious halimaw, also called motog but more commonly known as the devil swine, is an incredibly strong and cunning aswang. In its humanoid form, the halimaw often appears as a large, stocky, or rotund humanoid with a charming personality that masks its slothful and gluttonous behaviors. In its fiend form, it resembles a repulsive creature that has the hideous attributes of an **ogre**, a tusked boar, and a demon. It is often mistaken for a **wereboar**, a fact that the halimaw uses to mislead its adversaries.

***Criminal Overlord.*** A halimaw is a vile and greedy lowlife who sought power and advancement by successfully entering into an accursed pact with the demon lord **Baphomet**. By day, the halimaw could be the local thieves' guild master, criminal ringleader, or corrupt town mayor. By night, it transforms into an aswang and hunts its enemies - anyone that may pose a threat to its operations and feeds on their flesh and viscera.

***Master Manipulator.*** The halimaw is able to magically charm up to three humanoids at a time, which the aswang uses to full advantage. It often targets key political or business figures that help enable the halimaw's shady operations to become successful. Once a charmed target has outlived its usefulness, it is promptly devoured by the halimaw to tie up loose ends.

***Deadly Tusks.*** The halimaw is a very dangerous opponent and is considered by many as the most powerful type of aswang. Aside from being able to divide enemy ranks with its multiple charm ability and easily rip victims apart with its massive claws, its sharp tusks drip a deadly venom that can instantly kill those it gores.

### Aswang (Uh-swung)
An aswang is an accursed humanoid that transforms into a fiend. In its natural form, an aswang resembles a typical humanoid. At night, it can change its shape into a cunning, demonic predator. It hunts other humanoids and feasts on their blood, organs, or life force.

***Aswang Curse.*** A humanoid creature can be afflicted by the aswang curse after it willingly made or was tricked into making a dark pact with a Demon Lord, sometimes through the actions of a hag. One can also be born into it if one or both of its parents are aswangs. Casting *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or similar spell can free a humanoid of the curse, but a natural born aswang can only be freed of the curse with a *wish*. An aswang can either resist its curse or welcome it. By fighting the curse, an aswang keeps its normal behavior and personality while in its natural form. It can try to live its life as it wants but must constantly stave off the urge to feed. However, at nights of the full moon, the hunger becomes too great, and the curse overcomes the individual, forcing it to transform into its fiendish form. An aswang driven to this state becomes ravenous and will not stop hunting until it has fed. Each night that it fails to feed in its fiend form, it gains 1 level of exhaustion.

A genuinely depraved individual, or someone corrupted by it, sees the aswang curse as a gift and, over time, masters the ability to change into a fiend. However, an aswang can only transform at night and retain its demonic form until dawn, at which point it automatically transforms back to its humanoid form.

***Masters of Deception.*** Aswangs hide in plain sight, living amongst normal folk and often taking up occupations like butchers, hunters, gravediggers, taxidermists, and trappers to help divert suspicions of why their homes may sometimes smell of carrion and death. They insert themselves into humanoid communities and earn their neighbors' trust through charm, friendliness, and generosity. They avoid getting physically close to an individual, though, because if one looks directly at their eyes, they will discover that their reflection is upside down. Aswangs tend to prey on members of society that no one will miss if they suddenly disappear. If such targets are unavailable, they travel to another community, settlement, or location that is far from their homes. They won't risk feeding near where they live. Anyone who becomes suspicious of them, or sees them in their fiendish form, is always dealt with immediately for fear of rousing an organized mob. A successful clan of aswangs can live in the outskirts of town, preying on its citizens for years without getting caught. If things start to go awry, the aswangs will not risk staying. They will leave as soon as they can and establish themselves in another community to begin anew.

***Night Stalkers.*** Aswangs are careful, patient, and stealthy hunters, often choosing targets that are defenseless or weak. Typically during the day, aswangs pick and mark their target and identify where they live. At night after they transform, they stalk their prey and bide their time until they can attack when their target is most vulnerable. This means most of their assaults happen when their target is alone or asleep. They often just leave the bodies of their victims where they are to avoid the risk of getting caught. Because their kills bear specific types of wounds commonly attributed to ghouls, lycanthropes, or vampires, they aren't worried suspicions about their presence will be brought up.

***Aswang Weaknesses.*** Aswangs, much like vampires, have several weaknesses. They find the pungent smell of garlic repulsive, and the chemical properties of pure salt sicken it. While an aswang can resist most blows, weapons made from a stingray's barbed tail, even simple ones, can hurt them normally. Because they become fiends while transformed, they are susceptible to attacks that specifically harm fiends, such as holy water. If an aswang fails its saving throw against a *Dispel Evil and Good* spell, it reverts to its humanoid form and can't transform for 1 minute.

## Hobgoblin Annihilator

When a hobgoblin devastator demonstrates skill and more than just a natural affinity to evocation magic, it attracts the attention of the magistrates from the Academy of Devastation. Such a gifted individual is plucked from its ranks and is forced to undergo an advanced and more dangerous level of arcane training, exposing them to higher forms of evocation magic. Those that survive the deadly process eventually become annihilators.

## Kubot

### Kubot (Koo-bot)
The dreadful kubot is a female aswang who often appears as a stunningly beautiful young maiden in her humanoid form. Her alluring looks hide a dark personality, as the kubot is malicious, spiteful, and filled with conceit. In her fiend form, the kubot resembles a hag or female vampire with dark gray skin, clawed hands and feet, and massively long hair that billows like seaweed underwater. She moves like a spider, using her claws and hair to crawl across rooftops, tree branches, and steep walls.

***Vampiric Stalker.*** A female afflicted with the kubot curse ages a year each day. To revert to her young age, she must transform into a kubot and feed on the life force of a young humanoid. At night, the kubot prowls dark wooded areas, secluded farmlands, and shadowy alleys searching for youthful victims. She smothers and blinds her prey by forcibly shoving her tentacle-like hair strands into the victim's eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth. Once the target is secured, she drains it of its life essence, leaving nothing but a withered and dried husk. Afterwards, the kubot becomes as young as its last prey.

***The Dark Prince's Gift.*** It is said that the very first kubot was once a very attractive but vain and wicked aristocratic woman who, as she got older, became more envious and resentful of the young women who stole the attention away from her. She sought ways to look younger, and as she got more obsessed and insane, she secretly ordered young virgins murdered. She then bathed in their blood, believing that this would make her young. Her vile actions were eventually noticed by **Graz'zt** the Dark Prince, who then offered her the gift of eternal beauty. Desperate, the woman accepted and she was transformed to her 18-year old version. Unfortunately, she also gained the kubot curse.

***Duplicitous Nature.*** Because of how the curse affects her, a kubot often lives a double life. In most cases, she will act as a young daughter during her young days and portray her mother during long periods that she hasn't fed.

### Aswang (Uh-swung)
An aswang is an accursed humanoid that transforms into a fiend. In its natural form, an aswang resembles a typical humanoid. At night, it can change its shape into a cunning, demonic predator. It hunts other humanoids and feasts on their blood, organs, or life force.

***Aswang Curse.*** A humanoid creature can be afflicted by the aswang curse after it willingly made or was tricked into making a dark pact with a Demon Lord, sometimes through the actions of a hag. One can also be born into it if one or both of its parents are aswangs. Casting *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or similar spell can free a humanoid of the curse, but a natural born aswang can only be freed of the curse with a *wish*. An aswang can either resist its curse or welcome it. By fighting the curse, an aswang keeps its normal behavior and personality while in its natural form. It can try to live its life as it wants but must constantly stave off the urge to feed. However, at nights of the full moon, the hunger becomes too great, and the curse overcomes the individual, forcing it to transform into its fiendish form. An aswang driven to this state becomes ravenous and will not stop hunting until it has fed. Each night that it fails to feed in its fiend form, it gains 1 level of exhaustion.

A genuinely depraved individual, or someone corrupted by it, sees the aswang curse as a gift and, over time, masters the ability to change into a fiend. However, an aswang can only transform at night and retain its demonic form until dawn, at which point it automatically transforms back to its humanoid form.

***Masters of Deception.*** Aswangs hide in plain sight, living amongst normal folk and often taking up occupations like butchers, hunters, gravediggers, taxidermists, and trappers to help divert suspicions of why their homes may sometimes smell of carrion and death. They insert themselves into humanoid communities and earn their neighbors' trust through charm, friendliness, and generosity. They avoid getting physically close to an individual, though, because if one looks directly at their eyes, they will discover that their reflection is upside down. Aswangs tend to prey on members of society that no one will miss if they suddenly disappear. If such targets are unavailable, they travel to another community, settlement, or location that is far from their homes. They won't risk feeding near where they live. Anyone who becomes suspicious of them, or sees them in their fiendish form, is always dealt with immediately for fear of rousing an organized mob. A successful clan of aswangs can live in the outskirts of town, preying on its citizens for years without getting caught. If things start to go awry, the aswangs will not risk staying. They will leave as soon as they can and establish themselves in another community to begin anew.

***Night Stalkers.*** Aswangs are careful, patient, and stealthy hunters, often choosing targets that are defenseless or weak. Typically during the day, aswangs pick and mark their target and identify where they live. At night after they transform, they stalk their prey and bide their time until they can attack when their target is most vulnerable. This means most of their assaults happen when their target is alone or asleep. They often just leave the bodies of their victims where they are to avoid the risk of getting caught. Because their kills bear specific types of wounds commonly attributed to ghouls, lycanthropes, or vampires, they aren't worried suspicions about their presence will be brought up.

***Aswang Weaknesses.*** Aswangs, much like vampires, have several weaknesses. They find the pungent smell of garlic repulsive, and the chemical properties of pure salt sicken it. While an aswang can resist most blows, weapons made from a stingray's barbed tail, even simple ones, can hurt them normally. Because they become fiends while transformed, they are susceptible to attacks that specifically harm fiends, such as holy water. If an aswang fails its saving throw against a *Dispel Evil and Good* spell, it reverts to its humanoid form and can't transform for 1 minute.

It is said that once in every generation, a kuo-toa is born that is favored by Blipdoolpoolp herself. Known as a leviathan, this kuotoa would grow beyond its natural size. Its adult form is a giant 20-foot long bestial kuo-toa with an oversized mouth filled with rows of slender, sharp teeth and a long, eel-like tail. It is subservient to the priest-king and its archpriests.

In Fiend Form, the manananggal appears as a disembodied upper body of a vampire with bat-like wings. Its statistics, other than its Speed, damage, and damage resistances, are the same in each form. It reverts to its true form at dawn or if it dies. While transformed, the manananggal also gains the following features.  
>- The manananggal's creature type changes to fiend.
>- The manananggal has advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
>- When it makes a melee weapon attack, the manananggal gains a +3 bonus to the damage roll (included in the attack).

Before it can revert to its true form, the manananggal must use its action to graft back with its lower body.  
>If the lower body is destroyed, or its exposed separation point is covered with at least a pound of garlic or salt or a mixture of both, the manananggal can't graft with its lower body. If the manananggal is unable to rejoin its lower body by dawn, it and its lower body take 10 necrotic damage when it starts its turn.  
>
>***Horrific Appearance (Fiend Form Only).*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the manananggal and can see the manananggal must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the manananggal is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the manananggal 's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.  
>Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the manananggal's Fiend Form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the manananggal.

## Manananggal

### Manananggal (Muh-nuh-nuhng-guhl)
The disturbing manananggal is a vicious self-segmenting aswang that feeds on the heart, liver, and intestines of humanoids. By day, the manananggal appears as an attractive and charming humanoid, often with pale skin and long hair. In its horrifying fiend form, it resembles a disembodied upper torso of a humanoid with a pair of large, bat-like wings sprouting from its back and intestines dangling from under its exposed, severed waist. It has bloodshot eyes, wiry unkempt hair, leathery skin, a mouth filled with jagged teeth, a long, serpentine tongue, and claw-like hands that end in razor-sharp talons.

***Self-Segmentation.*** The manananggal's name means "to sever." When the manananggal transforms into its demonic form, it goes through a painful process where its torso separates from its lower body at the waist. Because its lower body becomes vulnerable while in this form, the manananggal takes steps to protect it, often hiding it in the attic, concealed compartments, or behind secret walls. The manananggal must attach itself back to its lower body before dawn, or else it will slowly die. If its lower body is destroyed, or if salt or garlic is poured on the exposed section of the lower body, the manananggal won't be able to attach itself.

***Opportunity Hunters.*** Manananggals often take up occupations of one who meets many people during the day, such as bakers, locksmiths, or shopkeepers. It provides them an opportunity to find potential victims, like pregnant women and children, because manananggals prefer to dine on unborn fetuses and the organs of young folk. By nightfall, they transform and head toward the home of their marked prey. Once there, they search for an opening into their sleeping target's room, often using open windows, chimneys, and roof egresses to gain access. Manananggals avoid direct combat, but if they are unable to feed via their preferred method, it searches and stalks for other suitable prey, targeting lone victims.

### Aswang (Uh-swung)
An aswang is an accursed humanoid that transforms into a fiend. In its natural form, an aswang resembles a typical humanoid. At night, it can change its shape into a cunning, demonic predator. It hunts other humanoids and feasts on their blood, organs, or life force.

***Aswang Curse.*** A humanoid creature can be afflicted by the aswang curse after it willingly made or was tricked into making a dark pact with a Demon Lord, sometimes through the actions of a hag. One can also be born into it if one or both of its parents are aswangs. Casting *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or similar spell can free a humanoid of the curse, but a natural born aswang can only be freed of the curse with a *wish*. An aswang can either resist its curse or welcome it. By fighting the curse, an aswang keeps its normal behavior and personality while in its natural form. It can try to live its life as it wants but must constantly stave off the urge to feed. However, at nights of the full moon, the hunger becomes too great, and the curse overcomes the individual, forcing it to transform into its fiendish form. An aswang driven to this state becomes ravenous and will not stop hunting until it has fed. Each night that it fails to feed in its fiend form, it gains 1 level of exhaustion.

A genuinely depraved individual, or someone corrupted by it, sees the aswang curse as a gift and, over time, masters the ability to change into a fiend. However, an aswang can only transform at night and retain its demonic form until dawn, at which point it automatically transforms back to its humanoid form.

***Masters of Deception.*** Aswangs hide in plain sight, living amongst normal folk and often taking up occupations like butchers, hunters, gravediggers, taxidermists, and trappers to help divert suspicions of why their homes may sometimes smell of carrion and death. They insert themselves into humanoid communities and earn their neighbors' trust through charm, friendliness, and generosity. They avoid getting physically close to an individual, though, because if one looks directly at their eyes, they will discover that their reflection is upside down. Aswangs tend to prey on members of society that no one will miss if they suddenly disappear. If such targets are unavailable, they travel to another community, settlement, or location that is far from their homes. They won't risk feeding near where they live. Anyone who becomes suspicious of them, or sees them in their fiendish form, is always dealt with immediately for fear of rousing an organized mob. A successful clan of aswangs can live in the outskirts of town, preying on its citizens for years without getting caught. If things start to go awry, the aswangs will not risk staying. They will leave as soon as they can and establish themselves in another community to begin anew.

***Night Stalkers.*** Aswangs are careful, patient, and stealthy hunters, often choosing targets that are defenseless or weak. Typically during the day, aswangs pick and mark their target and identify where they live. At night after they transform, they stalk their prey and bide their time until they can attack when their target is most vulnerable. This means most of their assaults happen when their target is alone or asleep. They often just leave the bodies of their victims where they are to avoid the risk of getting caught. Because their kills bear specific types of wounds commonly attributed to ghouls, lycanthropes, or vampires, they aren't worried suspicions about their presence will be brought up.

***Aswang Weaknesses.*** Aswangs, much like vampires, have several weaknesses. They find the pungent smell of garlic repulsive, and the chemical properties of pure salt sicken it. While an aswang can resist most blows, weapons made from a stingray's barbed tail, even simple ones, can hurt them normally. Because they become fiends while transformed, they are susceptible to attacks that specifically harm fiends, such as holy water. If an aswang fails its saving throw against a *Dispel Evil and Good* spell, it reverts to its humanoid form and can't transform for 1 minute.

Any creature within the area, other than a shadar-kai, takes 11 (2d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of the painbearer's turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

>### Reactions
>***Pain and Vengeance.*** When a creature within 5 feet of the painbearer is hit by an attack, the painbearer swaps places with that creature and is hit instead. The painbearer then makes a melee attack at the attacker.

## Sahuagin Malenti

### Malenti
Malentis are the mutated offspring of sahuagin that look nearly identical to sea elves, the sahuagins' sworn enemies, except for their retractable claws and fangs. Although shunned by sahuagin, the elders recognize their value and train them as spies and assassins, before sending them to infiltrate a sea elf colony. Despite spending most of their life with sea elves, malentis remain fiercely loyal to their kin.

## Sahuagin Shaman

Most sahuagin shamans worship Sekolah, but a few draw power from Olhydra, the Princess of Evil Water. These shamans focus on the elemental nature of water, harnessing and manipulating it against their enemies.

## Sahuagin Shark of Sekolah

The Shark of Sekolah is a sahuagin lycanthrope that is favored by the Shark God. In its humanoid form, the sahuagin has heightened senses and can smell blood within 500 feet. It is a bloodthirsty predator in shark form, but it is more terrifying in its hybrid form - a giant sahuagin with a large dorsal fin on its back, a pointed conical snout, a maw filled with razor-sharp jagged teeth, and a powerful crescent-shaped tail.

The Shark of Sekolah dislikes using weapons, favoring tearing enemies apart with just its claws and jaws. While the Shark of Sekolah often leads war parties of sahuagin, it prefers to hunt alone.

## Tigbanua

A tigbanua is a voracious predator and scavenger that resembles a gangly 7-foot tall humanoid with a long, flexible neck and a hideous head that, at first glance, looks like an eyeless cyclops. This is not the case, though, as the hollowed socket in the middle of its face is actually its nostrils. Its spindly arms and legs have oversized hands and feet, each ending in razor-sharp claws, and jagged teeth filled its horrid mouth. Despite its ghastly appearance, the tigbanua is not an undead creature.

***Cursed Humans.*** The tigbanuas was once a nomadic clan of cannibalistic humans who lived within the fringes of society. They preyed on lonely travelers and isolated families, moving from location to another once people became suspicious. But their vile activities were discovered, and a rabid mob nearly wiped them out. A few escaped into the wilderness but soon were starving to death. They stumbled upon the rotting corpse of a dead hunter, and because they were ravenous, ate it. Not long after, they became very ill. Experiencing excruciating pain and at the edge of death, they reached out to their false gods, imploring them to end their suffering. Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, answered instead and gave them a choice - die or receive its 'gift.' Each tigbanua unwittingly made the same choice and was transformed into what they appear now - a race of feral, ghoul-like humanoids.

***Supernatural Predator.*** Despite being completely blind, its other senses are heightened, making it a successful predator. It can smell carrion a mile away, and its long flexible necks and sensitive hearing enable it to hear and sense movement from any direction. Its powerful feral form allows it to pursue, catch, and bring down prey easier. The tigbanua also constantly exudes a supernatural aura that causes anyone around it to be filled with dread.

***Aswang Curse.*** Those that manage to survive a tigbanua's onslaught are still not free of danger, though, as those bitten by a tigbanua can become afflicted by a curse. Unless the curse is removed, the victim will transform into a **buso**, a type of aswang.

***Opportunistic Scavengers.*** Tigbanuas hunt in packs and prowl places where there is plenty of carrion, such as battlefields, cemeteries, and graveyards, as well as isolated areas and roads frequented by small groups of travelers.

>If the target is unconscious and takes damage or loses hit points, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fail to notice the attack.

## Tiktik

### Tiktik (Tik-tik)
A tiktik is a devious aswang often mistaken for a **vampire** or **werebat** because of its appearance. It is gangly, shifty, and slavering in its humanoid form, with an unusually long tongue and large nostrils. In its fiend form, the tiktik resembles a feral humanoid with dark leathery skin covered with a shallow layerof brown fur. A hard mask-like shell plating protects its face, and a row of bony protrusions line its spine. Like a vampire bat, the tiktik's wings are actually its fingers, with the membrane between the finger bones making up the wing. Its fingers and feet end in long, black talons. Its most distinct feature is its 10-foot long, tubular tongue that ends in a proboscis-like tip. Just like the **manananggal**, its tongue secretes anesthetic saliva that numbs the pain, allowing the tiktik to drain its victim at leisure.

***Specialized Predator.*** A tiktik's hunting behavior typically starts by flying over a town or village and searching for its favorite prey: unborn babies. Pregnant women give off a distinct odor which the tiktik can pick up even from miles away with its keen sense of smell. Upon reaching the home of its intended target, the tiktik will usually land on the victim's roof or wall beside a window adjacent to its prey. With the target's strong scent driving it ravenous, the tiktik begins to drool. It first checks if its prey is sleeping before it acts. It then starts digging a hole through the roof or window with its talons, creating a soft 'tiktik' sound from which the aswang gets its name. Once it has successfully created an aperture, it sends its snaking tongue inside to puncture the target's womb and suck the unborn fetus through its proboscis. If it can't find its favorite prey, the tiktik will settle for sucking the blood, liver, and heart from young folk and children. Because their tongue drips with anesthetic saliva, a sleeping victim may not notice the attack.

***Craven Pack Hunter.*** A tiktik fears direct combat and will flee if discovered. If cornered or caught, however, it will defend itself until it can find an opportunity to escape. A tiktik sometimes joins the company of other aswangs, especially **manananggals** and other tiktiks. These groups of aswang form hunting packs when they intend to attack a household.

### Aswang (Uh-swung)
An aswang is an accursed humanoid that transforms into a fiend. In its natural form, an aswang resembles a typical humanoid. At night, it can change its shape into a cunning, demonic predator. It hunts other humanoids and feasts on their blood, organs, or life force.

***Aswang Curse.*** A humanoid creature can be afflicted by the aswang curse after it willingly made or was tricked into making a dark pact with a Demon Lord, sometimes through the actions of a hag. One can also be born into it if one or both of its parents are aswangs. Casting *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or similar spell can free a humanoid of the curse, but a natural born aswang can only be freed of the curse with a *wish*. An aswang can either resist its curse or welcome it. By fighting the curse, an aswang keeps its normal behavior and personality while in its natural form. It can try to live its life as it wants but must constantly stave off the urge to feed. However, at nights of the full moon, the hunger becomes too great, and the curse overcomes the individual, forcing it to transform into its fiendish form. An aswang driven to this state becomes ravenous and will not stop hunting until it has fed. Each night that it fails to feed in its fiend form, it gains 1 level of exhaustion.

A genuinely depraved individual, or someone corrupted by it, sees the aswang curse as a gift and, over time, masters the ability to change into a fiend. However, an aswang can only transform at night and retain its demonic form until dawn, at which point it automatically transforms back to its humanoid form.

***Masters of Deception.*** Aswangs hide in plain sight, living amongst normal folk and often taking up occupations like butchers, hunters, gravediggers, taxidermists, and trappers to help divert suspicions of why their homes may sometimes smell of carrion and death. They insert themselves into humanoid communities and earn their neighbors' trust through charm, friendliness, and generosity. They avoid getting physically close to an individual, though, because if one looks directly at their eyes, they will discover that their reflection is upside down. Aswangs tend to prey on members of society that no one will miss if they suddenly disappear. If such targets are unavailable, they travel to another community, settlement, or location that is far from their homes. They won't risk feeding near where they live. Anyone who becomes suspicious of them, or sees them in their fiendish form, is always dealt with immediately for fear of rousing an organized mob. A successful clan of aswangs can live in the outskirts of town, preying on its citizens for years without getting caught. If things start to go awry, the aswangs will not risk staying. They will leave as soon as they can and establish themselves in another community to begin anew.

***Night Stalkers.*** Aswangs are careful, patient, and stealthy hunters, often choosing targets that are defenseless or weak. Typically during the day, aswangs pick and mark their target and identify where they live. At night after they transform, they stalk their prey and bide their time until they can attack when their target is most vulnerable. This means most of their assaults happen when their target is alone or asleep. They often just leave the bodies of their victims where they are to avoid the risk of getting caught. Because their kills bear specific types of wounds commonly attributed to ghouls, lycanthropes, or vampires, they aren't worried suspicions about their presence will be brought up.

***Aswang Weaknesses.*** Aswangs, much like vampires, have several weaknesses. They find the pungent smell of garlic repulsive, and the chemical properties of pure salt sicken it. While an aswang can resist most blows, weapons made from a stingray's barbed tail, even simple ones, can hurt them normally. Because they become fiends while transformed, they are susceptible to attacks that specifically harm fiends, such as holy water. If an aswang fails its saving throw against a *Dispel Evil and Good* spell, it reverts to its humanoid form and can't transform for 1 minute.
