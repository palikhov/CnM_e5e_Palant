[https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Barbarian_(5e_Creature)](Barbarian (dandwiki))

**Design Note:** If you are using the [https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction_(5e_Variant_Rule)](damage Reduction (5e Variant Rule)) the barbarian instead has an AC of 11, and a damage reduction value of 1.

Also known as brigands, barbarians are men who rely on pure strength and savagery in combat. Barbarians tend to make their homes in mountainous regions that organized armies have difficulty invading. Barbarians commonly make up thief groups, but it is common for them to hire themselves to others for money.

**Is always itching for a fight.** It has all the tools needed to pull off a movie-worthy bar brawl: it can move a grappled target at full speed across the top of a bar counter (knocking over drinks along the way) and is an expert at shoving poor fools through tables or into walls. They're equally adept at fighting with their fists or breaking off a chair leg and swinging it like a club! This Tavern Brawler is a dwarf, but it can easily be any race with minor modifications.

>***Sneak Attack (3d6).*** Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 3d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

>***Two Weapon Fighting.*** When you take the Attack action and Attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a Bonus Action to Attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus Attack, unless that modifier is negative.

## Cultist

[https://valldoesdnd.tumblr.com/image/148703473015](Cultist)

The common cultist is nothing for a wise adventurer to become concerned with. They are not brave, nor are they tough. They are, however, very devout towards the god they believe to worship, which can make them problematic in large numbers.

Dangerous rituals, hidden sects and background dealings are all evidence of cultist activity in an area. Smart adventurers would do well to stamp out this kind of activity, before fanatical fools begin to become to numerous and confident, or worse accidentally (or deliberately) unleashing far more horrifying and ancient terrors upon an unsuspecting world.

## Darkblade Agent

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pauper/comments/9fixlr/grn_darkblade_agent/](Darkblade Agents) are the most common type of field agents of the Dimir. While they can kill it is not their primary objective. They do recon and basic spy work. So if they are not identified they will most likely flee the scene instead of starting an open fight.

People do not fear drow assassins as much as they fear the drow scourges, due to the difference in notoriety. A lesser breed of killers would allow for a reputation of bloodshed to precede them, but drow assassins are not the most reputable humanoid killers of the Underdark, they are the deadliest. Little is known to others about these drow Occasionally, a noble will be found with their throat slit, or a party of adventurers will suddenly go missing. Drow assassins are not only careful in masking their handiwork, but will execute it with unheard of proficiency

Drow assassins were trained in the deepness of the underdark, under the tutelage of elite drow soldiers and mages. They can often come to the surface under their own motives or due to being contracted to dispatch a kill order. They are the best in the business when it comes to silence and discretion.Cutthroat Politics.Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.

## Drow Diviner

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4qy9a9/drow_expansion_pack_dd_monsters_of_different/](Drow Diviner (The Man Claw Expansion Drow Pack))

Drow mages are often powerful in the arcane arts. However, many drow spell-weavers specialize in other forms of magic. Diviners are male drow who do not fit the bill for traditional mages, or female drow who wish to avoid the cutthroat power politics of drow society, but still seek to make a name for themselves with other magic. In many ways, they act similarly to priestesses of Lolth, but not wielding the same levels of power; personal or political. With these abilities, other drow seek out diviners as healers or what could pass for sages in their society. That said, diviners tend to have a few highly destructive magic tricks up their sleeves, just in case things do not go their way.

This ability doesn't protect the matriarch from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball. If the matriarch makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, the ward effect ends.

Drow have a matriarchal society. Females of noble birth must fight tooth and nail with other female. competitors to secure a place power. Sometimes this is done way of shrewd power politics. Other times, a noble female drow will have to use her own physical force to get her way.

## Drow Novice Mage

One of the reasons drow mages are so powerful is that they have several human lifetimes to study magic. Gaining true mastery of magic for most drow mages takes a long time. It can be difficult for a drow mage to find a master because, in the true unforgiving spirit of drow society, a master might see a student as a threat to his own power or life. As such, an aspiring drow mage will spend decades working to forge (usually) his own fate

Merely invoking the name of the drow scourge will cause many an otherwise brave warrior to feel a chill through their spine. Scourges are the most deadly class of drow warriors. They serve as guards for royalty but, more commonly, as a strike force that one uses to not only destroy their target, but also make a statement with the sheer brutality of the attack. Scourges operate without mercy or remorse, laying waste to all those who stand in their way.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4qy9a9/drow_expansion_pack_dd_monsters_of_different/](Drow Stalker (The Man Claw Expansion Drow Pack))

Drow Stalkers are expert hunters of sentient prey. They attack unseen, and by the time their enemies know what is happening, it is already too late, as they are hit with a barrage of poisonous arrows and flurry of blades from shadows in all directions. In the rare event that an enemy manages to flee, they are quickly overtaken by the skilled trackers, only to realize their fate is inescapable.

## Guard Captain

[https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Guard_Captain_(5e_Creature)](Guard captains (dandwiki))

Guard captains are particularly influential guards, being effectively one step higher in their chain of command. One may have authority over anywhere from two to twenty lower-ranking guards. When keeping watch over a large area with a sizeable unit, the captain intends towards a central position from which commands can be issued most effectively. If a captain swears fealty to a kingdom or other large organization, it is likely subservient to knights, generals, or high-ranking nobles.

## Ivan the Terrible

[https://valldoesdnd.tumblr.com/](Ivan the Terrible)

A man swom to evil after his beloved scomed him and left with another man, Ivan is well known as a plun- derer, mercenery for hire and pirate. Happy to work for gold, Ivan has no concern for the lives of those he hurts - viewing it only as his justice on a world that took everything from him.

He is often armed with crazed contraptions of his own creation, and has been known to supply other, more dangerous foes than himself with lange volumes of ex- perimental weaponry in exchange for plunder of his own. Adventurers should take care when facing him, for it is rare that he is found alone.

"Come dancing with the devil? Best be leading it." .

- Janissary Ekrem

Janissaries are of the utmost elite soldiers. To them, their blades are an extension of their body, whirling them effortlessly, redirecting attacks that would normally hit them onto others. The saying "a great defense is a good offense" applies to all warriors, but for a Janissary, this means nothing to them, as their blades act as shields effortlessly deflecting attacks. They utilize their clawed gauntlets to fester deep wounds in opponents, causing opponents to either focus on the wounds to which they succumb to or the battle against whirling devil they fight. This combination of enthusiasm and skill has led many to be slain by their dancing blades

>***Improved Divine Smite.*** By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.  
>
>***Lay of Hands.*** Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.  
>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

[https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/BJ06j_vYx](Pelior Ashellon) from [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/5v08nw/high_level_cleric_npc_statblock/](High Level Cleric NPC Statblock)

**Champion of Cerys**

Pelior Ashellon is the most prolific cleric of Cerys, the Queen of Angels. Pelior lived her life as a Verenian Watcher, taking on many contracts over the course of her career, and growing in strength and in her dedication to her deity. Pelior is now in retirement, isolated away in a sanctuary of her own making on the top of Mount Berus on the northern island of Verftet.

Pelior is a grizzled war veteran, and while she tries to conduct herself with compassion, dignity and grace, she is not afraid to fight to defend the honor of Her Radiance, or to defend herself against the onslaught of any that would do her harm.

**Battle Routine**

Pelior would open a fight with a casting of spiritual weapon (at 6th level) and spirit guardians, relying on her [https://5e.tools/feats.html#war%20caster_phb,fbsr:war%20cast](War Caster) feat and legendary resistances to ensure that the latter stays up for as long as possible. She'll use legendary actions to keep pushing her aggressive battle routine closer and closer to the enemy, striking them with her warhammer and spiritual weapon as much as possible. Being a cleric herself, she would know how to focus down any healing enemies, and as a retired Verenian Watcher she has a good understanding of how to prioritize a well-balanced adventuring party that is working together.

Touched with a divine grace by their deity, sun knights are pillars that the righteous lean upon to combat the veil, They are bound by duty to end the existence of evil and corrupt creatures that turk in the shadows,

Beacon of Hope. Sun knights are able to channel the brightness of the sun itself through their holy symbols, illuminating the darkest corners of the world so they can purge the wicked from the realm. This searing light burns away the impurities that hide in the darkness, bringing the warmth of the sun's glow to the creatures that shy away from its brilliance.
